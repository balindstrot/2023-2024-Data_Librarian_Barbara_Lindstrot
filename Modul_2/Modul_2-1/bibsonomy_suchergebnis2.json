In an era of abundant growth of data and supporting infrastructure, proposals for the twinning of information and data science in library and information science schools aim to create expertise which would cater to the job market in need of data-oriented specialists. While data literacy creates the main line of discourse alternative approaches are being considered such as the concept of critical data literacy. A comprehensive thematic analysis of the critical data literacy discourse is undertaken to construct a comprehensive definition of critical data literacy and conceptualize its relation to the general thinking on related concepts. The articles were chosen based on the PRISMA instrument for construction of samples for systematic reviews and when submitted to its eligibility criteria 30 articles remained which were thematically analysed using the MAXQDA software. Our interpretive analysis uncovered five major themes: ontological treatment of data; critique of the epistemological status of data; literacy rationale situated in key problem accentuations; critical pedagogic articulation; and critical data literacy as ethics. We conclude that there is a growing need for terminological clarity in relation to the concepts of data and information considered in the context of the established discourse on critical data literacy.", "date": "2020-01-21 15:08:48", "changeDate": "2020-01-21 15:08:48", "count": 1, "url": "http://informationr.net/ir/24-4/colis/colis1922.html"}, {"type": "Bookmark", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/url/1dffeea65d3145ac3abad63f75d62b3a/danielle.dennie", "tags": ["data", "rdm_workshop"], "intraHash": "1dffeea65d3145ac3abad63f75d62b3a", "label": "Diving into Data: Developing Data Fluency for Librarians", "user": "danielle.dennie", "description": "Really good explanation of workshop series for librarians.

Triplify is based on mapping HTTP-URI requests onto relational database queries. Triplify transforms the resulting relations into RDF statements and publishes the data on the Web in various RDF serializations, in particular as Linked Data. The rationale for developing Triplify is that the largest part of information on the Web is already stored in structured form, often as data contained in relational databases, but usually published by Web applications only as HTML mixing structure, layout and content. In order to reveal the pure structured information behind the current Web, we have implemented Triplify as a light-weight software component, which can be easily integrated into and deployed by the numerous, widely installed Web applications. Our approach includes a method for publishing update logs to enable incremental crawling of linked data sources. Triplify is complemented by a library of con\ufb01gurations for common relational schemata and a REST-enabled data source registry. Triplify con\ufb01gurations containing mappings are provided for many popular Web applications, including osCommerce, WordPress, Drupal, Gallery, and phpBB. We will show that despite its light-weight architecture Triplify is usable to publish very large datasets, such as 160GB of geo data from the OpenStreetMap project.

A review of current literature was conducted to provide a robust and dimensional definition of data quality in the field of health care. This was used as the basis on which to assess the effect that electronic health care records has had in practice, specifically on data quality and according to the dimensions of accuracy, completeness and use of data. All of the papers reviewed referred to the importance of accuracy and completeness, identifying the advantages of electronic health records in their use of standardized data entry controls. Drawing on the third dimension in the definition, use of data, the impact that system design may have on data quality and implications for staff training is further discussed and recommendations made..

Academic institutions are putting together courses to address this shortage without fully understanding what the knowledge and skills requirements are for data professionals in different types of organisation types. This paper aims to increase that understanding.Interviews were conducted with 36 currently practicing data professionals and their employers about current knowledge and skills requirements. Participants were purposefully selected to achieve a cross section of data roles and employing institutions and interviews ceased once saturation was achieved.Two types of coding were employed: initial coding to establish categories, followed by more focused coding, for analytical depth. Every effort is made to accurately present the viewpoint of participants.

Though these requirements have been enforced for several years they do not always reach their aim. For instance, it is estimated that only 81% of publications funded by H2020 are in open access (from figures available on OpenAIRE website: : https://monitor.openaire.eu/h2020-stats-new, 20/12/2018). Good data management practices are even harder to monitor for funders and DMP writing does not always lead to practices improvement and to data openness. Funders like the European Commission or the French National Agency for Research (ANR) require a DMP only from funded projects. It means that most of the projects have not seriously considered data management and open science at the submission stage. Once the project is funded, it may be difficult to comply with open science requirements: it may occur that research partners do not agree on the level of data sharing or that no appropriate budget is dedicated to data preservation and dissemination. Funders requirements then appear to be only an administrative obligation which often leads to poor quality of practices and minimum data openness.\u00a0 This poster presents a new service implemented by the University Library of Lille to support researchers to take into account all dimensions of open science since the submission of their projects. Collaborating with other university services, we insist on integrating open science as a part of the project management activities by transforming obligations into objectives, deliverables and budget. Doing so, we make sure open science objectives and resources are well balanced. It is an opportunity for researchers to improve their project proposals and it is often appreciated by project reviewers. As a librarian, it is the best way to be considered as a partner and to create a strong relation with the project coordinator. Once a project is funded, the Library helps researchers to address open science issues and put into practice their commitments. A librarian is designated as the project open science manager. On open access, projects coordinators and their teams are provided with guidelines on funding signaling, on funders requirements and on self-archiving rights\u2026 Every publication related to the project has to be self-archived by researchers and signaled to the open science manager who makes sure the publications dissemination fulfills the project obligations. For H2020 projects, the open science manager checks that every publication is properly reported on the European Commission tools (OpenAIRE, participant portal). The open science manager is the contact point on open science issues for the European Commission projects officers. For mid-term or final reporting, the librarian produces a report on publications which includes information on open access dissemination, impact\u2026 Project coordinators and their teams are informed on research data management during the project kick-off meeting and other working meetings. Help is provided to write the project data management plan and specific guidance is proposed so that researchers are able to make relevant choices for research data management.", "date": "2019-03-28 16:16:03", "changeDate": "2019-03-28 16:16:03", "count": 1, "url": "https://zenodo.org/record/2547489#.XJzj9iAxmcx"}, {"type": "Bookmark", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/url/d4b630034232e49de85483c322416b0f/avs", "tags": ["Israel", "Photographien"], "intraHash": "d4b630034232e49de85483c322416b0f", "label": "Isratage - Younes & Soraya Nazarian Library - University of Haifa - Main Page", "user": "avs", "description": "The Library's activities for preserving the cultural heritage of the Land of Israel are part of a global initiative that views the academic library as a fundamental tool in the preservation of photographs and cultural artifacts.

One-day research tells us that moderate drinking is acceptable and that abstaining from alcohol altogether can lead to health problems such as dementia [1]. The following week, the latest research says that there are no safe levels of alcohol consumption [2]. Syntheses of research evidence, usually meta-analyses, suggest that there are harmful effects of drinking in older age; the apparent protective effects of moderate consumption may be due to misclassification bias, with previously heavy drinkers stopping drinking and being classified as non-drinkers [3, 4]. Unsafe and risky patterns of alcohol consumption have tended to be associated with binge drinking teens and young adults. We have only recently begun to pay attention to the drinking patterns of those in the middle and older age groups. Reports state that it is now older adults who are most at risk of unhealthy patterns of drinking. Specific public health interventions are needed to address this group [5, 6]..

The group headed by Michael Berthold is also using KNIME for teaching and research at the University. Quite a number of new data analysis methods developed at the chair are integrated in KNIME. Let us know if you are looking for something in particular, not all of those modules are part of the standard KNIME release just yet...\r\n\r\nKNIME base version already incorporates over 100 processing nodes for data I/O, preprocessing and cleansing, modelling, analysis and data mining as well as various interactive views, such as scatter plots, parallel coordinates and others. It integrates all analysis modules of the well known Weka data mining environment and additional plugins allow R-scripts to be run, offering access to a vast library of statistical routines.\r\n\r\nKNIME is based on the Eclipse platform and, through its modular API, easily extensible. When desired, custom nodes and types can be implemented in KNIME within hours thus extending KNIME to comprehend and provide first-tier support for highly domain-specific data. This modularity and extensibility permits KNIME to be employed in commercial production environments as well as teaching and research prototyping settings.

The movement towards evidence-based practice in psychotherapy has recently provoked a backlash. In the past few years, some authors have raised questions concerning the validity of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which have long been regarded as a crucial linchpin for evidence-based practice. These critics have argued that data from RCTs should not be prioritised above data derived from alternative evidentiary sources, such as observational studies, uncontrolled case studies, and clinical experience.1, 2 Although many of the criticisms have been aimed at RCT methodology in general, some sceptics have extended them to raise questions concerning the role of RCTs in the evaluation of psychological treatments..

What happens ?\r\n\r\n   1. On loading: jtwain.java loads it's C++ counter part, the library jtwain.dll.\r\n   2. jtwain.dll will load \"TWAIN_32.DLL\" and get a function pointer to the DSM (Data Source Manager) entry point (twain state 2).\r\n   3. If loading was successful jtwain.java creates a new thread that calls nstart in jtwain.cpp.\r\n   4. Due to the fact that twain is signalling events through the OS-dependent event queues, we need to set up an application window including it's wndProc callback function.\r\n   5. After that ninitLib will open the DSM (twain state 3). Now the DSM is ready to handle device specific requests.\r\n   6. The native thread is then entering the event loop and calling jtwain.cbhandleGetMessage whenever it receives an event.\r\n   7. The twain entry function must be called from within the native thread. In order to do that a command can be initiated from arbitrary java threads by calling ntrigger. This will cause the native thread to call jtwain.cbexecute.\r\n      Two commands can be triggered:\r\n         1. Select: The DSM will pop up a select dialog and the user can select a data source.\r\n         2. Acquire: The data source will pop up a user dialog that allows the user to set various settings and then either scan or cancel the request.

We illustrate the current process of using these libraries with a typical workflow, and highlight problems with managing data and metadata using URIs. We then examine a range of new applications such as Zotero, Mendeley, Mekentosj Papers, MyNCBI, CiteULike, Connotea, and HubMed that exploit the Web to make these digital libraries more personal, sociable, integrated, and accessible places.

An occupational therapist worked with five people with severe and profound learning disabilities and their support workers over one year.

You could say that Insurge puts the \"S\" in SOPAC. It provides the programmatic mechanism and social storage facility to any application built on top of it.\r\n\r\nInsurge also allows developers to harness the power of a repository of social data that can be imported via Locum and displayed via applications like SOPAC to bolster local bibliographic social data sets.\r\n", "date": "2009-07-20 22:28:05", "changeDate": "2009-07-20 22:28:05", "count": 2, "url": "http://thesocialopac.net/about"}, {"type": "Bookmark", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/url/19bc12f6d91af32e3ef64699845e5181/sssftlibrary", "tags": ["equality"], "intraHash": "19bc12f6d91af32e3ef64699845e5181", "label": "Global health burden and needs of transgender populations: a review- The Lancet", "user": "sssftlibrary", "description": "Transgender people are a diverse population affected by a range of negative health indicators across high-income, middle-income, and low-income settings.

However, many other health areas remain understudied, population-based representative samples and longitudinal studies are few, and routine surveillance efforts for transgender population health are scarce. The absence of survey items with which to identify transgender respondents in general surveys often restricts the availability of data with which to estimate the magnitude of health inequities and characterise the population-level health of transgender people globally.

See their agenda and the current draft recommendation (February, 15th) for details [via Panlibus]. I\u2019d like to shortly comment on the essential functions they agreed on at a meeting with major library system (ILS) vendors. Peter Murray summarized the functions as \u201cautomated interfaces for offloading records from the ILS, a mechanism for determining the availability of an item, and a scheme for creating persistent links to records.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the one hand I welcome if vendors try to agree on (open) standards and service oriented architecture. On the other hand the working group is yet another top-down effort to discuss things that just have to be implemented based on existing Internet standards.\r\n\r\n1. Harvesting: In the library world this is mainly done via OAI-PMH. I\u2019d also consider RSS and Atom. To fetch single records, there is unAPI - which the DLF group does not mention. There is no need for any other harvesting API - missing features (if any) should be integrated into extensions and/or next versions of OAI-PMH and ATOM instead of inventing something new.\r\n\r\n2. Search: There is still good old overblown Z39.50. The near future is (slightly overblown) SRU/SRW and (simple) OpenSearch. There is no need for discussion but for open implementations of SRU (I am still waiting for a full client implementation in Perl). I suppose that next generation search interfaces will be based on SPARQL or other RDF-stuff.\r\n\r\n2. Availability: The announcement says: \u201cThis functionality will be implemented through a simple REST interface to be specified by the ILS-DI task group\u201d. Yes, there is definitely a need (in december I wrote about such an API in German). However the main point is not the API but to define what \u201cavailability\u201d means. Please focus on this.\r\n\r\n3. Linking: For \u201cLinking in a stable manner to any item in an OPAC in a way that allows services to be invoked on it\u201d (announcement) there is no need to create new APIs. Add and propagate clean URIs for your items and point to your APIs via autodiscovery (HTML link element). That\u2019s all. Really. To query and distribute general links for a given identifier, I created the SeeAlso API which is used more and more in our libraries.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the draft contains a section on \u201cPatron functionality\u201d which is going to be based on NCIP and SIP2. Both are dead ends in my point of view. You should better look at projects outside the library world and try to define schemas/ontologies for patrons and patron data (hint: patrons are also called \u201ccustomer\u201d and \u201cuser\u201d). Again: the API itself is not underdefined - it\u2019s the data which we need to agree on.", "date": "2008-04-19 00:29:23", "changeDate": "2008-04-19 00:29:23", "count": 1, "url": "http://jakoblog.de/2008/04/13/working-group-on-digital-library-apis-and-possible-outcomes/"}, {"type": "Bookmark", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/url/d0bcecca2b792984dd2b67b85a972fe7/sssftlibrary", "tags": ["safeguardingchildren", "socialcare"], "intraHash": "d0bcecca2b792984dd2b67b85a972fe7", "label": "From doing to being: the tensions of systemic practice in social work \u2013 group reflective supervision in child protection - Bingle - - Journal of Family Therapy - Wiley Online Library", "user": "sssftlibrary", "description": "This research aimed to consider the impact of introducing the systemic approach to child protection practice through the forum of group reflective supervision. A single case discussion was observed, recorded and transcribed and the data interpreted using thematic analysis (Braun and Clark, 2006). The social workers observed were trained in the systemic approach to foundation level. The data generated showed social workers using hypotheses to put forward ideas about a family shaped by systemic principles. However the inclusion of a pathologising discourse about a mother being blind to the sexual abuse of her daughter and an absence of self\u2010reflexivity suggested social workers were limited by linear thinking. The paper uses this data to suggest a tension between systemic practice and the child protection paradigm. The findings illustrate the challenge of occupying a systemic posture (the being) and the application of systemic concepts and techniques (the doing) in child protection. This paper recommends that systemic practice be taught and supported in social work to shape a more robustly reflexive systemic \u2018being' in the child protection context..

The choices of models, schemas, and elements used in each library's LD can create interoperability issues for LD services because of substantial differences between schemas and data models evolving via local decisions. The researchers observed that a wide variety of vocabularies and ontologies were used for LLD including common web schemas such as Dublin Core (DC)/DCTerms, Schema.org and Resource Description Framework (RDF), as well as deprecated schemas such as MarcOnt and rdagroup1elements. A sharp divide existed as well between LLD schemas using variations of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) data model and those with different data models or even with no listed data model.

This paper reports the thoughts and the strategy developed by the MATIS laboratory of the Institut G\u00b4eographique National (IGN) about an efficient lidar library design in order to tackle these issues. The specification of an efficient and versatile lidar file format is first discussed. The standard and current lidar file formats are first reviewed and a new one, dedicated to raw data processing with high feature modularity is presented. Besides, existing code components and libraries are reviewed with regard to their compatibility for research development. Modularity, availability and license conditions are here the main selection criteria. Then, differents strategies for large data set handling are summarized and extended by a new solution, both based on lidar strip and raw sensor topology. These workflows are illustrated through a UML activity diagram dedicated to 2D spatial query.

This final report of the Incubator Group examines how Semantic Web standards and Linked Data principles can be used to make the valuable information assets that library create and curate \u2014 resources such as bibliographic data, authorities, and concept schemes \u2014 more visible and re-usable outside of their original library context on the wider Web.\n      \n      The Incubator Group began by eliciting reports on relevant activities from parties ranging from small, independent projects to national library initiatives (see the separate report, Library Linked Data Incubator Group: Use Cases) USECASE.

Design/methodology/approach Content analysis of research publications on data science was made of papers published in the Web of Science database to identify the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective. Findings A content analysis of 80 publications is presented. The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related.

A Gibbs sampler\r\nis described for simulating random draws from the probability distribution of\r\nthe parameters, given the observed data.

The simulations illustrate that the Gaussian\r\nmixture model outperforms other common estimators and can effectively give\r\nconstraints on the regression parameters, even when the measurement errors\r\ndominate the observed scatter, source detection fraction is low, or the\r\nintrinsic distribution of the independent variables is not a mixture of\r\nGaussians.

This software can be used to fit multi-state models with one initial state (e.g., illness diagnosis), a finite number of intermediate states, representing, for example, a change of treatment, and one absorbing state corresponding to a terminal event of interest. Graphical output includes survival estimates, transition probabilities estimates and smooth log hazard for continuous covariates.", "pmid": "17350136", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2007.01.010", "bibtexKey": "MeiraMachado:2007:Comput-Methods-Programs-Biomed:17350136"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/200c8254ffb9f3b13e5e7918909c1389d/lepsky", "tags": ["data_science", "bibliotheken"], "intraHash": "00c8254ffb9f3b13e5e7918909c1389d", "interHash": "7adf06fb730cabfc04fc9e9bc7dea648", "label": "Data science from a library and information science perspective", "user": "lepsky", "description": "", "date": "2019-10-14 17:29:00", "changeDate": "2019-10-14 17:30:49", "count": 2, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Data Technologies and Applications", "year": "2019", "url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/DTA-05-2019-0076/full/html", "author": ["Sirje Virkus", "Emmanouel Garoufallou"], "authors": [{"first": "Sirje", "last": "Virkus"}, {"first": "Emmanouel", "last": "Garoufallou"}], "abstract": "Data science is a relatively new field which has gained considerable attention in recent years.

Within this instruction, Data Information Literacy competencies help define student-learning objectives for data management tasks. Currently data management education is a combination of theory and active learning, with students asking for more hands-on practice. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION This program is an 8-week, in-person, flipped classroom series that addresses all data life cycle stages and aligns with many Data Information Literacy competencies. It is entirely student research data focused in that activities require that they use their projects, with significant time allocated to implement these practices while in the classroom.

This article reviews current efforts to connect music data through the Semantic Web, with an emphasis on the Music Ontology (MO) and ontology alignment approaches; it also presents a framework for understanding the life cycle of a musical work, focusing on the central activities of composition, performance, and use. The project studied metadata structures and properties of 11 music-related LD data sets and mapped them to the descriptions commonly used in the library cataloging records for sound recordings and musical scores (including MARC records and their extended schema.org markup), and records from 20 collections of digitized music recordings and scores (featuring a variety of metadata structures). The analysis resulted in a set of crosswalks and a unified crosswalk that aligns these properties. The paper reports on detailed methodologies used and discusses research findings and issues. Topics of particular concern include (a) the challenges of mapping between the overgeneralized descriptions found in library data and the specialized, music-oriented properties present in the LD data sets; (b) the hidden information and access points in library data; and (c) the potential benefits of enriching library data through the mapping of properties found in library catalogs to similar properties used by LD data sets.", "issn": "1532-2890", "doi": "10.1002/asi.22914", "bibtexKey": "gracy2013exploring"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/23223c61b119d298ec30b86e5ced98bac/joschirr", "tags": ["design,", "Libraries,", "data", "Librarians,", "Data", "Research", "development,", "Graduates,", "Science", "management,", "Statistical", "Software", "policy,"], "intraHash": "3223c61b119d298ec30b86e5ced98bac", "interHash": "9a323d1ae8d26110d17ac399a78f901d", "label": "Practices of research data curation in institutional repositories: A qualitative view from repository staff", "user": "joschirr", "description": "", "date": "2018-12-31 11:11:57", "changeDate": "2018-12-31 11:13:30", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "year": "2017", "url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173987", "author": ["Dong Joon Lee", "Besiki Stvilia"], "authors": [{"first": "Dong Joon", "last": "Lee"}, {"first": "Besiki", "last": "Stvilia"}], "volume": "12", "number": "3", "pages": "e0173987", "abstract": "The importance of managing research data has been emphasized by the government, funding agencies, and scholarly communities. Increased access to research data increases the impact and efficiency of scientific activities and funding. Thus, many research institutions have established or plan to establish research data curation services as part of their Institutional Repositories (IRs). However, in order to design effective research data curation services in IRs, and to build active research data providers and user communities around those IRs, it is essential to study current data curation practices and provide rich descriptions of the sociotechnical factors and relationships shaping those practices. Based on 13 interviews with 15 IR staff members from 13 large research universities in the United States, this paper provides a rich, qualitative description of research data curation and use practices in IRs. In particular, the paper identifies data curation and use activities in IRs, as well as their structures, roles played, skills needed, contradictions and problems present, solutions sought, and workarounds applied.

This study analyses the solutions offered by generalist scientific data repositories, i.e., repositories supporting the deposition of any type of research data. These repositories cannot make any assumption on the application domain. They are actually called to face with the almost open ended typologies of data used in science. The current practices promoted by such repositories are analysed with respect to eight key aspects of data publishing, i.e., dataset formatting, documentation, licensing, publication costs, validation, availability, discovery and access, and citation. From this analysis it emerges that these repositories implement well consolidated practices and pragmatic solutions for literature repositories. These practices and solutions can not totally meet the needs of management and use of datasets resources, especially in a context where rapid technological changes continuously open new exploitation prospects.", "copyright": "Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:    Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution License  that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.

Moreover, the structural and semantic heterogeneity of ecological data sets makes the development of custom solutions for integrating and querying these data prohibitively costly for large-scale synthesis. The Data Manager Library leverages the Ecological Metadata Language to provide automated data processing features that allow efficient data access, querying, and manipulation without custom development. The library can be used for many data management tasks and was designed to be immediately useful as well as extensible and easy to incorporate within existing applications.

With limited amount or degraded RNA, alternative protocols such as the NuGEN have been developed. However, it is not yet clear how the different library preparations affect the downstream analyses of the broad applications of RNA sequencing.  Methods and Materials Eight human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) lines with high quality RNA were sequenced by Illumina\u2019s mRNA-Seq PolyA selection and NuGEN ENCORE library preparation. The following analyses and comparisons were conducted: 1) the numbers of genes captured by each protocol; 2) the impact of protocols on differentially expressed gene detection between biological replicates; 3) expressed single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection; 4) non-coding RNAs, particularly lincRNA detection; and 5) intragenic gene expression.  Results Sequences from the NuGEN protocol had lower (75%) alignment rate than the PolyA (over 90%). The NuGEN protocol detected fewer genes (12\u201320% less) with a significant portion of reads mapped to non-coding regions. A large number of genes were differentially detected between the two protocols. About 17\u201320% of the differentially expressed genes between biological replicates were commonly detected between the two protocols. Significantly higher numbers of SNVs (5\u20136 times) were detected in the NuGEN samples, which were largely from intragenic and intergenic regions. The NuGEN captured fewer exons (25% less) and had higher base level coverage variance. While 6.3% of reads were mapped to intragenic regions in the PolyA samples, the percentages were much higher (20\u201325%) for the NuGEN samples. The NuGEN protocol did not detect more known non-coding RNAs such as lincRNAs, but targeted small and \u201cnovel\u201d lincRNAs.  Conclusion Different library preparations can have significant impacts on downstream analysis and interpretation of RNA-seq data. The NuGEN provides an alternative for limited or degraded RNA but it has limitations for some RNA-seq applications.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0071745", "bibtexKey": "10.1371/journal.pone.0071745"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/26325c36a271bc0de41f8bd423c3cff58/wdees", "tags": ["bibliothek", "software", "visualisierung"], "intraHash": "6325c36a271bc0de41f8bd423c3cff58", "interHash": "80196a08551ab742ac7d3b999751c84c", "label": "Visualizing library data interactively: two demonstrations using R language", "user": "wdees", "description": "Visualizing library data interactively: two demonstrations using R language | Library Hi Tech News | Ahead of Print", "date": "2018-07-23 12:01:47", "changeDate": "2018-07-23 12:01:47", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Library Hi Tech News", "publisher": "Emerald", "year": "2018", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1108%2Flhtn-01-2018-0003", "author": ["Zhehan Jiang", "Richard Carter"], "authors": [{"first": "Zhehan", "last": "Jiang"}, {"first": "Richard", "last": "Carter"}], "doi": "10.1108/lhtn-01-2018-0003", "bibtexKey": "jiang2018visualizing"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/212adfa35f62e5af74a89b2c4bd6cc795/fbw_hannover", "tags": ["imported"], "intraHash": "12adfa35f62e5af74a89b2c4bd6cc795", "interHash": "55e655a0665666a462a4b9e611a5b93c", "label": "Information Retrieval Management", "user": "fbw_hannover", "description": "", "date": "2009-08-21 12:35:02", "changeDate": "2009-08-21 12:35:16", "count": 1, "pub-type": "proceedings", "series": "Data Processing Library Series", "publisher": "American Data Processing", "address": "Detroit, Mich.", "year": "1962", "url": "http://gso.gbv.de/DB=2.1/CMD?ACT=SRCHA&SRT=YOP&IKT=1016&TRM=ppn+226780791&sourceid=fbw_bibsonomy", "editor": ["Lowell H.

The advent of novel computing infrastructures such as computational grids and clouds make these issues even more urgent. The design and implementation of a common data format for quantum chemistry (QC) and quantum dynamics (QD) computer programs is discussed with reference to the research performed in the course of two Collaboration in Science and Technology Actions. The specific data models adopted, Q5Cost and D5Cost, are shown to work for a number of interoperating codes, regardless of the type and amount of information (small or large datasets) to be exchanged. The codes are either interfaced directly, or transfer data by means of wrappers; both types of data exchange are supported by the Q5/D5Cost library. Further, the exchange of data between QC and QD codes is addressed. As a proof of concept, the H\u2009+\u2009H2 reaction is discussed. The proposed scheme is shown to provide an excellent basis for cooperative code development, even across domain boundaries. Moreover, the scheme presented is found to be useful also as a production tool in the grid distributed computing environment. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "issn": "1096-987X", "doi": "10.1002/jcc.23492", "bibtexKey": "JCC:JCC23492"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/25b75d7a66abc65eac1cac86b3862582b/fezett", "tags": ["imported"], "intraHash": "5b75d7a66abc65eac1cac86b3862582b", "interHash": "173407a26f92450320438a03ca725d0a", "label": "Scribl: an HTML5 Canvas-based graphics library for visualizing genomic data over the web", "user": "fezett", "description": "", "date": "2016-01-18 15:13:04", "changeDate": "2016-01-18 15:15:28", "count": 2, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "publisher": "Oxford Univ Press", "year": "2013", "url": "", "author": ["Chase A.

For some data sources with problems, there is no option to ask for corrections or updates, and the processing steps must do their best with the values in hand. Such circumstances arise in processing survey data, in constructing knowledge bases or data warehouses 1 and in using some public or open data sets.\r\n\r\nThe goal of data cleaning, sometimes called data editing or integrity checking, is to improve the accuracy of each data record and by extension the quality of the data set as a whole. Generally, this is accomplished through deterministic processes that recode specific data points according to static rules based entirely on data from within the individual record. This traditional method works well for many purposes. However, when high levels of inconsistency exist within an individual respondent's data, classification scoring may provide better results.\r\n\r\nClassification scoring is a two-stage process that makes use of information from more than the individual data record. In the first stage, population data is used to define a model, and in the second stage the model is applied to the individual record. The author and colleagues turned to a classification scoring method to resolve inconsistencies in a key value from a recent health survey. Drawing records from a pool of about 11,000 survey respondents for use in training, we defined a model and used it to classify the vital status of the survey subject, since in the case of proxy surveys, the subject of the study may be a different person from the respondent. The scoring model was tested on the next several months' receipts and then applied on a flow basis during the remainder of data collection to the scanned and interpreted forms for a total of 18,841 unique survey subjects. Classification results were confirmed through external means to further validate the approach.

To achieve that, we first seek to understand what kind of organizational and technological issues are impeding the planning, production, preservation, and dissemination of data in laboratories. Then, we propose a conceptualization of laboratory work using the lens of experimental systems theory, which provides a socio-technical perspective on the building blocks of scientific experimentation. Finally, we apply the lens of reproducible experimental systems further to design a laboratory forensics approach for investigating storage systems in laboratories. The laboratory forensics approach is a starting point of experimental resources discovery and evaluation in labs. Next, we draw upon the results of forensic investigations to shape open science readiness, which is an ensemble of RDM practices and technology that supports reproducible and open practices in laboratories. The goal of pursuing the design of open science readiness for laboratories is to foster evidence-based research data management that effectively achieves the preservation and dissemination of research data in an open and FAIR way. Therefore, the main research question of this dissertation is stated as follows: &#xD;&#xA;How can we organize research data management for preserving and disseminating laboratory experiments in a reproducible way?&#xD;&#xA;First, we start with organizational and technological issues among stakeholders involved in research data management. First, we examine the cooperation between researchers and data managers. By doing so, an agenda for open data in academia is proposed based on qualitative research highlighting issues such as lack of proper infrastructure, accountability, legal frameworks, and rewards in research data management. At the same time, new roles such as data stewards and the struggles with data management support are investigated. To further determine stakeholders\u2019 needs and practices, a similar exploratory approach is used to discover how funding agencies and data management support develop a research data strategy in the Netherlands. &#xD;&#xA;Then, we elaborate on the concept of reproducibility in experimental science. To achieve that, we dive into data management issues from a technological point of view, showing what types of reproducibility issues occur in storage systems with laboratory forensics techniques. Moreover, we investigate reproducibility in research data management by mapping laboratory work and the scholarly infrastructure to a socio-technical model. As such, we obtain a more comprehensive view of reproducibility issues and refine organizational and technical aspects of reproducibility challenges in practice. &#xD;&#xA;Finally, we illustrate some applications of \u201cFAIR technology\u201d. First, we show the need for designing reproducible and reusable research software with the reproducible, research-oriented knowledge discovery in databases process (RRO-KDD). Then we present a strategy for open science readiness.

A linear regression analysis method is used to improve the performance of the instruments using light scattering method. The data measured by these instruments have to be converted to actual PM10 concentrations using some factors. These findings propose that the instruments using light scattering method can be used to measure and control the PM10 concentrations of the underground subway stations. In this study, the reliability of the instrument for PM measurement using light scattering method was improved with the help of a linear regression analysis technique to continuously measure the PM10 concentrations in the subway stations. In addition, the linear regression analysis technique was also applied to calibrate a radon counter with the help of an expensive radon measuring apparatus.

Around 40 stakeholders from the chemistry, chemical information, and software communities took part in the two-day workshop entitled \u201cFAIR Chemical Data Publishing Guidelines for Chemical Structures and Spectra.\u201d Major topics discussed included publishing data workflows and guidelines, FAIR criteria/metadata profiles, value propositions, a publisher implementation pilot, and community support and engagement. This report summarizes the workshop conversations, major outcomes, and target areas for further activities. Primary outcomes from the workshop include identification of key metadata elements for sharing machine-readable structures and spectra, a sample of concise author guidelines, and a publisher proposal to accept enhanced supporting information files including these data types and associated metadata alongside articles. Selected target areas for further activities include the creation of author file and metadata packaging tools to facilitate easy compilation of data, and increased training for stakeholders specifically in the generation and handling of machine-readable file formats.

Furthermore, the subject has been rather inaccessible to the general statistician.\n\nThe account presented in this book places emphasis on topics of methodological importance, in the hope that this will facilitate broader practical application of density estimation and also encourage research into relevant theoretical work. The book also provides an introduction to the subject for those with general interests in statistics. The important role of density estimation as a graphical technique is reflected by the inclusion of more than 50 graphs and figures throughout the text.\n\nSeveral contexts in which density estimation can be used are discussed, including the exploration and presentation of data, nonparametric discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, simulation and the bootstrap, bump hunting, projection pursuit, and the estimation of hazard rates and other quantities that depend on the density. This book includes general survey of methods available for density estimation. The Kernel method, both for univariate and multivariate data, is discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on ways of deciding how much to smooth and on computation aspects. Attention is also given to adaptive methods, which smooth to a greater degree in the tails of the distribution, and to methods based on the idea of penalized likelihood.", "citeulike-article-id": "13991558", "isbn": "9780412246203", "citeulike-linkout-2": "http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9780412246203", "citeulike-linkout-1": "http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780412246203", "citeulike-linkout-4": "http://www.librarything.com/isbn/9780412246203", "citeulike-linkout-3": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=9780412246203&index=books&linkCode=qs", "priority": "2", "citeulike-linkout-5": "http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12558006", "posted-at": "2016-03-31 12:28:13", "citeulike-attachment-1": "Silverman1986_p42-49_sec341to342_choosingsmoothing.pdf; /pdf/user/pbett/article/13991558/1064830/Silverman1986_p42-49_sec341to342_choosingsmoothing.pdf; 1346b7f902a7216a1717b891be7bd774082a0008", "file": "Silverman1986_p42-49_sec341to342_choosingsmoothing.pdf", "citeulike-linkout-0": "https://www.crcpress.com/Density-Estimation-for-Statistics-and-Data-Analysis/Silverman/9780412246203", "comment": "(private-note)Well-known stats textbook for KDE etc. In library at 519.22 SIL.", "bibtexKey": "Silverman1986Density"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "963", "tags": ["forschungsdaten", "informationskompetenz"], "intraHash": "050e0cdb34b24dd32fa6f8ba1c914ed3", "interHash": "01431a69fcc4a1ce0a6b5c6ea79ff18c", "label": "How many ways can we teach data literacy?", "user": "wdees", "description": "How many ways can we teach data literacy? | IASSIST Quarterly", "date": "2020-01-09 09:04:22", "changeDate": "2020-01-09 09:04:22", "count": 1, "pub-type": "misc", "year": "2019", "url": "https://www.iassistquarterly.com/index.php/iassist/article/view/963", "author": ["Yun Dai"], "authors": [{"first": "Yun", "last": "Dai"}], "volume": "43", "number": "4", "pages": "1-11", "abstract": "Academic Libraries are ideally positioned to teach data literacy.

Design/methodology/approach A mixed method approach was used and had two main data collection phases. A survey of public libraries was used to generate an overview of which professional roles connect public libraries with Big Data. Eight roles were identified, namely, educator, marketer, data organiser, data container, advocator, advisor, developer and organisation server. Semi-structured interviews with library directors and managers were then conducted to gain a deeper understanding of these roles and how they connect to the library's overall functions. Findings Results of the survey indicated that librarians lack a proper comprehension of and a pragmatic application of Big Data. Their opinions on the eight roles are slightly stronger than neutral. However, they do not demonstrate any strong agreement on these eight roles. In the interviews, the eight roles attained more clear support and are classi...", "issn": "0264-0473", "doi": "10.1108/EL-06-2016-0134", "bibtexKey": "Zhan2018"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/24e26a7e7320ffc7326e03dba57a48826/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "4e26a7e7320ffc7326e03dba57a48826", "interHash": "7adf06fb730cabfc04fc9e9bc7dea648", "label": "Data science from a library and information science perspective.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2019-11-26 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2019-11-27 11:45:44", "count": 2, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Data Technol.

Offering  extensive ecosystem services such as climate regulation and rich biodiversity has raised increasing \r\nconcerns about their future and protection. Latest studies conducted at a global scale have defined Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay as the countries with the highest rates of deforestation in South America. With an area of about 250 000 km\u00b2, the Paraguayan Chaco covers about one fourth of the  Great American Chaco which spreads out over Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay. The Paraguayan  Chaco comprises not only a great variety of ecosystems such as savannahs, shrublands, grasslands and \r\nwetlands but also holds the largest dry forest area on earth. Furthermore, the ecoregion has been  acknowledged as an important carbon sink on a global scale. Nevertheless, uninterrupted \r\ndeforestation activities between 1987 and 2012 resulted in the loss of 27 % of its original cover. The  constant expansion of agricultural crops, cattle ranching, and illegal logging have severely fragmented \r\nthe Paraguayan Chaco transforming the last forest remnants into isolated patches, jeopardizing not  only their continuity but also the biodiversity comprised within. In this context, this study focuses on the \r\nassessment of the annual forest cover between 2016 and 2020 using Sentinel-1 and -2 on the one hand  and estimating forest structure parameters with data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation \r\n(GEDI) on the other. Annual forest / non-forest masks generated through machine learning algorithms show a continuous annual decrease of the forest cover. Between the years 2016 and 2020 9 % of the \r\nnatural forest cover was lost, resulting in 12 500 km\u00b2 (Figure 1a)). Regarding forest structure, more than  7.2 million valid lidar shots have been analysed to determine forest height, vertical Plant-Area-Volume\ufffdDensity, Foliage-Height-Diversity-Index (FHDI) and Plant-Area-Index (PAI). Preliminary results exhibit that  more than 55 % of the forest height is between 3 to 9 meters (Figure 1b)) and heights greater than 15  meters are mainly located in the North-East of the Paraguayan Chaco. Additionally, vegetation density  appears to be rather sparse which is described by mean values of total canopy cover (17 %) and PAI \r\n(0.44 m\u00b2/m\u00b2). On the other hand, highest vegetation densities and closed forest canopies are observed  in the North and North-East (Chaco Biosphere Reserve) where most of the protected areas and  indigenous reserves are located. Overall continuous expansion of the agricultural frontier, illegal logging  activities, and the constant demand for natural goods threaten the continuity of the tropical forest. To \r\nmeet these challenges, there is an urgent need to develop methods and approaches in the field of  remote sensing observations. This would simplify the implementation of environmental laws and \r\nconservation programs orientated toward protecting the last remnants of natural forest on the  continent. Countries with large, forested areas such as Paraguay should be taking advantage of the  latest natural resources available to halt and monitor deforestation activities in the country. With \r\nupcoming data from GEDI and fusion products of optical and lidar sensors, global forest structure data  will improve estimates of above-ground biomass models to better quantify global carbon fluxes, further \r\nhighlight drastic losses of forests and promote environmental-sound land use.", "bibtexKey": "kacic2021foreststructure"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/24a81a0e4c629244e710fe912d6122773/flint63", "tags": ["database", "paper", "management", "optimize", "data", "acm", "01821", "theory"], "intraHash": "4a81a0e4c629244e710fe912d6122773", "interHash": "c64b7366f663306a0cf59641ee0b80c8", "label": "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks", "user": "flint63", "description": "", "date": "2016-11-21 10:24:43", "changeDate": "2018-04-16 12:07:39", "count": 18, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Communications of the ACM", "year": "1970", "url": "", "author": ["Edgar F.

One particular such data set from economics is described. This set has a 24 factorial design with eight variables measured on each individual, but the application of MANOVA seems inadvisable given the highly skewed nature of the data. To establish a basis for analysis, we examine the structure of distance matrices in the presence of a priori grouping of units and show how the total squared distance among the units of a multivariate data set can be partitioned according to the factors of an external classification. The partitioning is exactly analogous to that in the univariate analysis of variance. It therefore provides a framework for the analysis of any data set whose structure conforms to that of MANOVA, but which for various reasons cannot be analysed by this technique. Descriptive aspects of the technique are considered in detail, and inferential questions are tackled via randomization tests.

Also\n\ta typical meteorological year (TMY) has been built from this database.\n\tFirstly, a neural network block has been trained based on 60 known\n\tmonthly solar radiation data from the TMY. In this way, the network\n\twas trained to accept and even handle a number of unusual cases.\n\tThe neural network can generate the monthly solar radiation data.\n\tSecondly, these data have been divided by corresponding extraterrestrial\n\tvalue in order to obtain the monthly clearness index values. Based\n\ton these monthly clearness indexes and using a library of MTM block\n\twe can generate the sequences of daily clearness indexes. Known data\n\twere subsequently used to investigate the accuracy of the prediction.\n\tFurthermore, the unknown validation data set produced very accurate\n\tprediction; with an RMSE error not exceeding 8% between the measured\n\tand predicted data.

We present a new methodology for data-driven interrogation and training of signaling networks. While most published methods for signaling network inference operate on Bayesian, Boolean, or ODE models, our approach uses integer linear programming (ILP) on interaction graphs to encode constraints on the qualitative behavior of the nodes. These constraints are posed by the network topology and their formulation as ILP allows us to predict the possible qualitative changes (up, down, no effect) of the activation levels of the nodes for a given stimulus. We provide four basic operations to detect and remove inconsistencies between measurements and predicted behavior: (i) find a topology-consistent explanation for responses of signaling nodes measured in a stimulus-response experiment (if none exists, find the closest explanation); (ii) determine a minimal set of nodes that need to be corrected to make an inconsistent scenario consistent; (iii) determine the optimal subgraph of the given network topology which can best reflect measurements from a set of experimental scenarios; (iv) find possibly missing edges that would improve the consistency of the graph with respect to a set of experimental scenarios the most. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach by interrogating a manually curated interaction graph model of EGFR/ErbB signaling against a library of high-throughput phosphoproteomic data measured in primary hepatocytes. Our methods detect interactions that are likely to be inactive in hepatocytes and provide suggestions for new interactions that, if included, would significantly improve the goodness of fit. Our framework is highly flexible and the underlying model requires only easily accessible biological knowledge.

(2002)\r\nand Zomorodian and Carlsson (2005) in persistent homology and was popularized\r\nin a landmark paper in 2009 Carlsson (2009). tda is mainly motivated by the\r\nidea that topology and geometry provide a powerful approach to infer robust\r\nqualitative, and sometimes quantitative, information about the structure of\r\ndata-see, e.g. Chazal (2017). tda aims at providing well-founded mathematical,\r\nstatistical and algorithmic methods to infer, analyze and exploit the complex\r\ntopological and geometric structures underlying data that are often represented\r\nas point clouds in Euclidean or more general metric spaces. During the last few\r\nyears, a considerable eort has been made to provide robust and ecient data\r\nstructures and algorithms for tda that are now implemented and available and\r\neasy to use through standard libraries such as the Gudhi library (C++ and\r\nPython) Maria et al. (2014) and its R software interface Fasy et al. (2014a).\r\nAlthough it is still rapidly evolving, tda now provides a set of mature and\r\necient tools that can be used in combination or complementary to other data\r\nsciences tools. The tdapipeline. tda has recently known developments in various\r\ndirections and application elds. There now exist a large variety of methods\r\ninspired by topological and geometric approaches. Providing a complete overview\r\nof all these existing approaches is beyond the scope of this introductory\r\nsurvey. However, most of them rely on the following basic and standard pipeline\r\nthat will serve as the backbone of this paper: 1. The input is assumed to be a\r\nnite set of points coming with a notion of distance-or similarity between them.\r\nThis distance can be induced by the metric in the ambient space (e.g. the\r\nEuclidean metric when the data are embedded in R d) or come as an intrinsic\r\nmetric dened by a pairwise distance matrix. The denition of the metric on the\r\ndata is usually given as an input or guided by the application. It is however\r\nimportant to notice that the choice of the metric may be critical to reveal\r\ninteresting topological and geometric features of the data.", "bibtexKey": "chazal2017introduction"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/22e74cf11afd6f4274f3caefd99d9c7b4/flint63", "tags": ["paper", "optimize", "data", "processing", "01841", "acm", "analysis", "algorithm"], "intraHash": "2e74cf11afd6f4274f3caefd99d9c7b4", "interHash": "90829d729bb7e240151323849f45dabf", "label": "Data Sketching", "user": "flint63", "description": "", "date": "2017-10-30 12:22:27", "changeDate": "2018-04-16 12:06:33", "count": 3, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Communications of the ACM", "year": "2017", "url": "", "author": ["Graham Cormode"], "authors": [{"first": "Graham", "last": "Cormode"}], "volume": "60", "number": "9", "pages": "48--55", "abstract": "The approximate approach is often faster and more efficient.

At the start, the legal framework encompassing public sector information is expounded along with the basic approaches for its disclosure. The practices of publishing data as open data are de?ned as an approach for proactive disclosure that is based on the application of the principle of openness to data with the goal to enable equal access and equal use of the data. The reviewed practices range from necessary legal actions, choices of appropriate technologies, and ways in which the technologies should be used to achieve the best data quality. Linked data is presented as a knowledge technology that, for the most part, ful?ls the requirements on open technology suitable for open data. The thesis extrapolates further from the adoption of linked open data in the public sector to recognize the impact and challenges proceeding from this change.

This methodology named for its features  factorial   k - means analysis  has a very wide range of applications since it fulfills a double objective: data reduction and synthesis, simultaneously in the direction of objects and variables; variable selection in cluster analysis, identifying variables that most contribute to determine the classification of the objects. The least-squares fitting problem proposed here is mathematically formalized as a quadratic constrained minimization problem with mixed variables. An iterative alternating least-squares algorithm based on two main steps is proposed to solve the quadratic constrained problem. Starting from the cluster centroids, the subspace projection is found that leads to the smallest distances between object points and centroids. Updating the centroids, the partition is detected assigning objects to the closest centroids. At each step the algorithm decreases the least-squares criterion, thus converging to an optimal solution. Two data sets are analyzed to show the features of the factorial  k -means model.

However, open and standard pipelines to perform RNA-seq analysis by non-experts remain challenging due to the large size of the raw data files and the hardware requirements for running the alignment step. Here we introduce a reproducible open source RNA-seq pipeline delivered as an IPython notebook and a Docker image. The pipeline uses state-of-the-art tools and can run on various platforms with minimal configuration overhead. The pipeline enables the extraction of knowledge from typical RNA-seq studies by generating interactive principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering (HC) plots, performing enrichment analyses against over 90 gene set libraries, and obtaining lists of small molecules that are predicted to either mimic or reverse the observed changes in mRNA expression. We apply the pipeline to a recently published RNA-seq dataset collected from human neuronal progenitors infected with the Zika virus (ZIKV). In addition to confirming the presence of cell cycle genes among the genes that are downregulated by ZIKV, our analysis uncovers significant overlap with upregulated genes that when knocked out in mice induce defects in brain morphology.

One of the outcomes of e-science is the increasing amount of data being produced in digital form with potential for re-use. In order to facilitate re-use such data needs to be managed both in terms of curation and preservation. An essential aspect of curation is enabling the discovery of that data. As publication, discovery, and re-use become recognised as aspects of the life-cycle of research data, then the overlap between management of raw and derived data (datasets produced by experimentation and data collection) and the management of bibliographic data (in particular metadata describing digital resources) become obvious.  There are overlaps as regards supporting technologies e.g. OAI-PMH, and overlaps between services that might be offered e.g. linking datasets and journal articles. There are increasing commonalities in the concerns of those developing digital libraries and those creating and managing research data. In the UK the eBank project is funded by the Joint Information System's Committee (JISC) as part of its Semantic Grid programme in order to demonstrate how dissemination of research data can be made easier.Currently once a research experiment is finished the initial dissemination may be via a letter or communication, followed later by a more detailed explanation in a full paper. eBank will demonstrate how data might be 'published' directly in open archives and subsequently linked to final peer-reviewed journal articles. As the availability of journal article e-prints increases users would benefit a service linking back to the raw or processed data. The objective is to make 'publishing' and discovery of research data easier, in order to facilitate re-use of data in further experiments.  The eBank project represents an opportunity to bring together the digital library community with the Grid / computer science community. An eBank demonstrator is being developed within the chemistry domain (crystallography) with a view to assessing the feasibility of a generic approach across other disciplines. The Combechem Project at the University of Southampton offers an ideal research testbed since large quantities of heterogeneous data are being generated including electronic lab books, crystallography data and physical chemistry data. The demonstrator shows how an e-prints repository of peer-reviewed journal articles can include links to associated metadata describing research data. The demonstrator is using the technical architecture currently being deployed within the ePrints UK Project. The ePrints UK architecture supports the harvesting of metadata from e-print archives in UK academic institutions and elsewhere using the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). The eBank project will augment this work by harvesting metadata desribing research data from the University of Southampton institutional 'e-data repository'. Research data is deposited in an OAI compliant institutional repository at the University of Southampton, and metadata describing the data holdings made available for harvesting. The workflow of capturing data from experimentation through the various stages of derived data is being undertaken as part of the complementary Combechem project. An enhanced version of the e-prints.org software accommodates self-archiving by chemists. The ePrints UK project harvests the metadata and makes appropriate links to published journal articles. The paper focuses in particular on the eBank architecture linking the research data repository at the University of Southampton to a central ePrints UK search service hosted at the University of Bath. The paper also gives an account of the proposed data flow with associated metadata schemas, suggesting a simple generic schema for a high level description of research data.", "bibtexKey": "Heery2004"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/28da3f4efe836787bb28e9a38577848ec/gdmcbain", "tags": ["65n50-pdes-bvps-mesh-generation-and-refinement"], "intraHash": "8da3f4efe836787bb28e9a38577848ec", "interHash": "32885b6bfdca92a8212a223806e0a7a1", "label": "EXODUS: A Finite Element Data Model", "user": "gdmcbain", "description": "SAND2008-xxxx\r\nDRAFT\r\nDraft Date:  June 3, 2019", "date": "2020-01-08 01:46:59", "changeDate": "2020-01-08 01:53:48", "count": 1, "pub-type": "unpublished", "year": "2019", "url": "https://gsjaardema.github.io/seacas/exodusII-new.pdf", "author": ["Gregory D.

Big science  fields such as physics and astronomy that collaborate around expensive instrumentation have constructed shared digital libraries to manage their data and documents, while  little science  research areas that gather data through hand-crafted fieldwork continue to manage their data locally. As habitat ecology researchers begin to deploy embedded sensor networks, they are confronting an array of challenges in capturing, organizing, and managing large amounts of data. The scientists and their partners in computer science and engineering make use of common datasets but interpret the data differently. Studies of this field in transition offer insights into the role of digital libraries in e-Science, how data practices evolve as science becomes more instrumented, and how scientists, computer scientists, and engineers collaborate around data. Among the lessons learned are that data on the same variables are gathered by multiple means, that data exist in many states and in many places, and that publication practices often drive data collection practices. Data sharing is embraced in principle but little sharing actually occurs, due to interrelated factors such as lack of demand, lack of standards, and concerns about publication, ownership, data quality, and ethics.

In the second part we present an ontology engineering framework that supports and favours the genericity of an ontology. We introduce the DOGMA ontology engineering approach that separates atomic conceptual relations from predicative domain rules. A DOGMA ontology consists of an ontology base that holds sets of intuitive context-specific conceptual relations and a layer of relatively generic ontological commitments that hold the domain rules. This constitutes what we shall call the double articulation of a DOGMA ontology.", "file": "ACM Digital Library:2000-04/SpynsMeersmanJarrar02sigmod.pdf:PDF", "issn": "0163-5808", "groups": "public", "intrahash": "08c8fb00ce33616a86e3e6a60be21da8", "doi": "10.1145/637411.637413", "timestamp": "2010.07.17", "username": "flint63", "bibtexKey": "SpynsMeersmanJarrar02sigmod"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/26ce1c63d7bb9f4d6fba05abd10196369/flint63", "tags": ["semantic", "data", "ai", "engineering", "ieee", "rules", "v1205", "paper", "management", "processing", "business", "knowledge", "ontology"], "intraHash": "6ce1c63d7bb9f4d6fba05abd10196369", "interHash": "c54db2e0f07fc657537b59849c6bd9c1", "label": "Data Integration Using Semantic Technology: A Use Case", "user": "flint63", "description": "", "date": "2012-05-30 10:42:22", "changeDate": "2018-04-16 11:45:52", "count": 2, "pub-type": "inproceedings", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Rules and Rule Markup Languages for the Semantic Web, Athens, GA, USA", "year": "2006", "url": "", "author": ["J\u00fcrgen Angele", "Michael Gesmann"], "authors": [{"first": "J\u00fcrgen", "last": "Angele"}, {"first": "Michael", "last": "Gesmann"}], "pages": "58-66", "abstract": "For the integration of data that resides in autonomous data sources Software AG uses ontologies. Data source ontologies describe the data sources themselves. Business ontologies provide an integrated view of the data. F-Logic rules are used to describe mappings between data objects in data source or business ontologies. Furthermore, F-Logic is used as the query language. F-Logic rules are perfectly suited to describe the mappings between objects and their properties. Some of these mapping rules can be generated automatically from the data sources meta data. Some patterns do frequently reoccur in user-defined mapping rules, for instance rules which establish inverse object relations or rules which create new object relations based on the objects' property values. Within our first project access to information is still typical data retrieval and not so much knowledge inference. Therefore, a lot of effort in this project concentrated on query functionality and even more on performance. But these are only first steps.

Many of the recent work make use of kernels or graphs in order to combine varied categories of features, which normally presume one weight for one category of features. These algorithms don't consider the correlation of graph structure between multiple views, and the clustering results highly based on the value of predefined affinity graphs. Artificial Bee Colony is combined to Multi view Clustering ABC MVC model in order to combine each and every one of features and learn the weight for each feature with respect to each cluster separately by new joint structured sparsity inducing norms. It also solves the issue of MVC by seamlessly combining the graph structures of varied views in order to completely make use of the geometric property of underlying data structure. ABC MVC model is based on the presumption with the purpose of intrinsic underlying graph structure would assign related connected part in each graph toward the similar group. Implementation results shows that the proposed ABC MVC model gets improved clustering accuracy than the other conventional methods such as Graph Structure Fusion GSF and Multiview Clustering with Graph Learning MVGL .

The purpose of this paper is to report and evaluate an exploratory project into new techniques for collection development at the University of Manchester Library. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The project employed a cross-team approach where a relatively large number of staff tried some innovative and experimental approaches to individual aspects of a large and complex task in a large, research-intensive university library. The overriding aim was to exploit data to support decision making and to push automation as far as possible. Findings \u2013 The quality of (meta)data remains a huge hindrance to data-driven approaches. A proper understanding of usage data is an urgent but intractable issue. Human input and relationships are still important. Data are nothing without analysis, and many librarians currently lack the data fluency to work confidently in a world of dynamic content curation. Practical implications \u2013 Librarians need both to re-skill and to change their self-identification and the philosophy that underlies it if they are to achieve confident, data fluency. Originality/value \u2013 The University of Manchester Library was one of the first libraries in the UK to make a thoroughgoing structural change from subject-based to functional teams.

Later the book turns to the authors' downloadable Weka (rhymes with \"Mecca\") Java class library, which lets you experiment with data mining hands-on and gets you started with this technology in custom applications. Final sections look at the bright prospects for data mining and machine learning on the Internet (for example, in Web search engines). <p> Precise but never pedantic, this admirably clear title delivers a real-world perspective on advantages of data mining and machine learning. Besides a programming how-to, it can be read profitably by any manager or developer who wants to see what leading-edge machine learning techniques can do for their software. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Data mining and machine learning basics, sample datasets and applications for data mining, machine learning vs. statistics, the ethics of data mining, generalization, concepts, attributes, missing values, decision tables and trees, classification rules, association rules, exceptions, numeric prediction, clustering, algorithms and implementations in Java, inferring rules, statistical modeling, covering algorithms, linear models, support vector machines, instance-based learning, credibility, cross-validation, probability, costs (lift charts and ROC curves), selecting attributes, data cleansing, combining multiple models (bagging, boosting, and stacking), Weka (reusable Java classes for machine learning), customizing Weka, visualizing machine learning, working with massive datasets, text mining, and e-mail and the Internet.", "priority": "0", "isbn": "1558605525", "citeulike-linkout-0": "http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=citeulike09-20&amp;path=ASIN/1558605525", "citeulike-linkout-9": "http://www.librarything.com/isbn/1558605525", "posted-at": "2006-03-06 15:59:57", "citeulike-linkout-5": "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=citeulike07-20&path=ASIN/1558605525", "citeulike-linkout-6": "http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/1558605525", "citeulike-linkout-7": "http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1558605525", "citeulike-linkout-8": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?keywords=1558605525&index=books&linkCode=qs", "citeulike-article-id": "167557", "citeulike-linkout-1": "http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=citeulike01-21&amp;path=ASIN/1558605525", "citeulike-linkout-2": "http://www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=citeulike06-21&amp;path=ASIN/1558605525", "citeulike-linkout-3": "http://www.amazon.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558605525", "citeulike-linkout-4": "http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558605525/citeulike00-21", "bibtexKey": "witten99data"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2a41619c0b2df2930eb83220daec5ff7c/flint63", "tags": ["semantic", "paper", "management", "data", "enterprise", "ai", "ieee", "analysis", "v1500", "information", "zzz.big"], "intraHash": "a41619c0b2df2930eb83220daec5ff7c", "interHash": "f0fb5536f1d08dcaa353542c5ac7411f", "label": "Integrating Big Data: A Semantic Extract-Transform-Load Framework", "user": "flint63", "description": "", "date": "2015-03-31 17:53:11", "changeDate": "2018-04-16 11:36:20", "count": 2, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Computer", "year": "2015", "url": "", "author": ["Srividya K.

The FAIR Data Principles establish how to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (Wilkinson et al., 2016). The FAIR principles are as follows:\u00a0 To Be Findable F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier. F2. data are described with rich metadata. F3. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource. F4. metadata specify the data identifier. To Be Accessible: A1 \u00a0(meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol. A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable. A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary. A2 metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available. To Be Interoperable I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles. I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data. To Be Reusable R1. meta(data) have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes. R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license. R1.2. (meta)data are associated with their provenance. R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.\u00a0 Methodology Based on the FAIR Data Principles, two questionnaires were created. The first (hereafter \\#Q1 - see Appendix \\#1) targeted repository managers and/or librarians and consisted of 40 questions. The second (hereafter \\#Q2 - see Appendix \\#2) targeted technical staff responsible for repository development and maintenance and consisted of 25 questions.\u00a0 Members of LIBER\u2019s Research Data Management (RDM) Working Group\u00a0circulated the questionnaires between December 2018 and February 2019. Responses were collected from managers and/or librarians of 29 repositories for the first (\\#Q1) questionnaire.\u00a0 In addition, technical staff responsible for the development and maintenance of 14 repositories (Table 1) responded to the second (\\#Q2) questionnaire.

Vast quantities of born-digital data are being produced in a wide variety of forms at a rapid rate in universities.

In particular it: examines the roles and relationships involved in RDM, identifies the main components of an RDM programme, evaluates the major drivers for RDM activities, and analyses the key factors influencing the shape of RDM developments. The study is written from the perspective of library professionals, analysing data from 26 semi-structured interviews of library staff from different UK institutions. This is an early qualitative contribution to the topic complementing existing quantitative and case study approaches. Results show that although libraries are playing a significant role in RDM, there is uncertainty and variation in the relationship with other stakeholders such as IT services and research support offices. Current emphases in RDM programmes are on developments of policies and guidelines, with some early work on technology infrastructures and support services. Drivers for developments include storage, security, quality, compliance, preservation, and sharing with libraries associated most closely with the last three. The paper also highlights a \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 driver in which libraries are claiming a role in this space. A wide range of factors, including governance, resourcing and skills, are identified as influencing ongoing developments. From the analysis, a model is constructed designed to capture the main aspects of an institutional RDM programme. This model helps to clarify the different issues involved in RDM, identifying layers of activity, multiple stakeholders and drivers, and a large number of factors influencing the implementation of any initiative. Institutions may usefully benchmark their activities against the data and model in order to inform ongoing RDM activity.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0114734", "bibtexKey": "10.1371/journal.pone.0114734"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/20f123a39efbaade6ac7b1ea97b4885c1/cstrasser", "tags": ["imported", "carlysD1"], "intraHash": "0f123a39efbaade6ac7b1ea97b4885c1", "interHash": "0eb97eca761ab7bbdef647cda92fe267", "label": "Sharing Detailed Research Data Is Associated with Increased Citation Rate", "user": "cstrasser", "description": "", "date": "2010-11-18 23:10:33", "changeDate": "2010-11-18 23:10:34", "count": 2, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "publisher": "Public Library of Science", "year": "2007", "url": "http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308", "author": ["Heather A.

Reduction of environmental burden or everyday environmental actions played an important role in the day-to-day activities of libraries. Libraries are in an excellent position to be both an ecological operator and promoter of environmental awareness. The methodology employed is survey. data collected was analyzed using decision mean of 3.00. findings from the study revealed that, libraries in Nigeria are not well ground on green library requirements, due to insufficient manpower, and tools. As a result of this, this study recommends that librarians must faces the challenge of finding solutions that adequately address these issues without compromising its economic development goals and the living standards of its people through environment awareness, communication strategies and reduction on environmental burden. Resumo:  A pegada de carbono se tornou uma forma popular de comunicar as quest\u00f5es das mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ti1cas e a necessidade de mudar o comportamento. A redu\u00e7\u00e3o da carga ambiental ou a\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais cotidianas tiveram um papel importante nas atividades do dia-a-dia das bibliotecas.

The browser security model designed for static web pages, however, was insufficient to mitigate the security concerns in mashups. Recent efforts by researchers have enhanced the security model of browsers and provided newer APIs to meet the security requirements of mashups. However, these low- level APIs require significant skill by developers to use them effectively, to avoid creating possibly unsafe applications. In this paper, we start with a survey of security concerns in the insecure usage of HTML5 APIs, particularly relevant to the security of mashups. We then present a high-level library called SafeMash, which helps developers build safe mashups over the current low-level security APIs in HTML5. SafeMash allows the mashup developer to configure the de- gree of interaction and communication of a widget. It warns developers in case of any misconfiguration. Our initial em- pirical analysis shows that an interactive mashup that does not leverage state-of-the-art browser security features can be rebuilt with SafeMash, without any loss in functionality.", "acmid": "2593764", "location": "Hyderabad, India", "isbn": "978-1-4503-2855-5", "numpages": "8", "doi": "10.1145/2593761.2593764", "bibtexKey": "TelCho14"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/28992be78da84761dc687e328231ef894/voss", "tags": ["researchdata", "digitalscholarship"], "intraHash": "8992be78da84761dc687e328231ef894", "interHash": "f6a3ef6b6f0763c45fe9e5b5ff97e7c7", "label": "Research Data Management Instruction for Digital Humanities", "user": "voss", "description": "", "date": "2017-12-10 12:22:27", "changeDate": "2018-01-19 13:14:32", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Journal of eScience Librarianship (JeSLIB)", "year": "2017", "url": "https://doi.org/10.7191/jeslib.2017.1115", "author": ["Willow Dressel"], "authors": [{"first": "Willow", "last": "Dressel"}], "volume": "6", "number": "2", "abstract": "eScience related library services at Princeton University started in response to the National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) data management plan requirements, and grew to encompass a range of services including data management plan consultation, assistance with depositing into a disciplinary or institutional repository, and research data management instruction.

Applicability to the digital humanities was initially recognized by discovery of related efforts from the history department\u2019s Information Technology (IT) manager in the form of a graduate-student workshop on file and digital-asset management concepts. Seeing the common ground these activities shared with research data management, a collaboration was formed between the history department\u2019s IT Manager and the eScience Librarian to provide a research data management overview to the entire campus community. The eScience Librarian was then invited to participate in the history department\u2019s graduate student file and digital asset management workshop to provide an overview of other research data management concepts. Based on the success of the collaboration with the history department IT, the eScience Librarian offered to develop a workshop for the newly formed Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton.

One of the outcomes of e-science is the increasing amount of data being produced in digital form with potential for re-use. In order to facilitate re-use such data needs to be managed both in terms of curation and preservation. An essential aspect of curation is enabling the discovery of that data. As publication, discovery, and re-use become recognised as aspects of the life-cycle of research data, then the overlap between management of raw and derived data (datasets produced by experimentation and data collection) and the management of bibliographic data (in particular metadata describing digital resources) become obvious.  There are overlaps as regards supporting technologies e.g. OAI-PMH, and overlaps between services that might be offered e.g. linking datasets and journal articles. There are increasing commonalities in the concerns of those developing digital libraries and those creating and managing research data. In the UK the eBank project is funded by the Joint Information System's Committee (JISC) as part of its Semantic Grid programme in order to demonstrate how dissemination of research data can be made easier.Currently once a research experiment is finished the initial dissemination may be via a letter or communication, followed later by a more detailed explanation in a full paper. eBank will demonstrate how data might be 'published' directly in open archives and subsequently linked to final peer-reviewed journal articles. As the availability of journal article e-prints increases users would benefit a service linking back to the raw or processed data. The objective is to make 'publishing' and discovery of research data easier, in order to facilitate re-use of data in further experiments.  The eBank project represents an opportunity to bring together the digital library community with the Grid / computer science community. An eBank demonstrator is being developed within the chemistry domain (crystallography) with a view to assessing the feasibility of a generic approach across other disciplines. The Combechem Project at the University of Southampton offers an ideal research testbed since large quantities of heterogeneous data are being generated including electronic lab books, crystallography data and physical chemistry data. The demonstrator shows how an e-prints repository of peer-reviewed journal articles can include links to associated metadata describing research data. The demonstrator is using the technical architecture currently being deployed within the ePrints UK Project. The ePrints UK architecture supports the harvesting of metadata from e-print archives in UK academic institutions and elsewhere using the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). The eBank project will augment this work by harvesting metadata desribing research data from the University of Southampton institutional 'e-data repository'. Research data is deposited in an OAI compliant institutional repository at the University of Southampton, and metadata describing the data holdings made available for harvesting. The workflow of capturing data from experimentation through the various stages of derived data is being undertaken as part of the complementary Combechem project. An enhanced version of the e-prints.org software accommodates self-archiving by chemists. The ePrints UK project harvests the metadata and makes appropriate links to published journal articles. The paper focuses in particular on the eBank architecture linking the research data repository at the University of Southampton to a central ePrints UK search service hosted at the University of Bath. The paper also gives an account of the proposed data flow with associated metadata schemas, suggesting a simple generic schema for a high level description of research data.", "citeulike-article-id": "10005896", "priority": "2", "posted-at": "2011-11-09 00:54:10", "pdf": "file:///H:/publications/Heery2004.pdf", "location": "Frascati, Italy", "bibtexKey": "Heery2004"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2e07c8c8a3c8fd5c4aaae206366d995ca/flint63", "tags": ["database", "paper", "data", "01841", "acm", "analysis", "user", "secure"], "intraHash": "e07c8c8a3c8fd5c4aaae206366d995ca", "interHash": "e540d86e2866d781bf5b664c5c557241", "label": "Privacy Integrated Queries: An Extensible Platform for Privacy-Preserving Data Analysis", "user": "flint63", "description": "", "date": "2012-05-30 10:50:47", "changeDate": "2018-04-16 12:09:24", "count": 2, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Communications of the ACM", "year": "2010", "url": "", "author": ["Frank McSherry"], "authors": [{"first": "Frank", "last": "McSherry"}], "volume": "53", "number": "9", "pages": "89--97", "abstract": "Privacy Integrated Queries (PINQ) is an extensible data analysis platform designed to provide unconditional privacy guarantees for the records of the underlying data sets.

An active Linked Open Data for Libraries, Archives and Museums (LODLAM) community exists, CH data is published as LOD, and international collaborations have emerged. The value of LOD is especially high in the GLAM sector, since culture by its very nature is cross-border and interlinked. We present interesting LODLAM projects, datasets, and ontologies, as well as Ontotext's experience in this domain. This is an extended version of an invited report at the DIPP 2018 conference that covers CH content and XML standards, Wikidata and global authority control.", "bibtexKey": "Alexiev2018-MuseumLOD-extended"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2ae554cd588aa5098f61836d33a83991b/flint63", "tags": ["learn", "development", "software", "book", "data", "ai", "01841", "recognition", "analysis", "apache", "102", "pattern", "safari", "middleware", "zzz.big"], "intraHash": "ae554cd588aa5098f61836d33a83991b", "interHash": "f9d15054b1fd2c59c331a9324fa57918", "label": "Advanced Analytics with Spark: Patterns for Learning from Data at Scale", "user": "flint63", "description": "", "date": "2017-07-09 11:41:31", "changeDate": "2018-04-16 12:15:46", "count": 1, "pub-type": "book", "publisher": "O'Reilly", "address": "Beijing", "year": "2017", "url": "https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/advanced-analytics-with/9781491972946/", "author": ["Sandy Ryza", "Uri Laserson", "Sean Owen", "Josh Wills"], "authors": [{"first": "Sandy", "last": "Ryza"}, {"first": "Uri", "last": "Laserson"}, {"first": "Sean", "last": "Owen"}, {"first": "Josh", "last": "Wills"}], "abstract": "In the second edition of this practical book, four Cloudera data scientists present a set of self-contained patterns for performing large-scale data analysis with Spark. The authors bring Spark, statistical methods, and real-world data sets together to teach you how to approach analytics problems by example. Updated for Spark 2.1, this edition acts as an introduction to these techniques and other best practices in Spark programming. You'll start with an introduction to Spark and its ecosystem, and then dive into patterns that apply common techniques---including classification, clustering, collaborative filtering, and anomaly detection---to fields such as genomics, security, and finance. If you have an entry-level understanding of machine learning and statistics, and you program in Java, Python, or Scala, you'll find the book's patterns useful for working on your own data applications.", "file": "O'Reilly eBook:2015/RyzaLasersonEtAl15.pdf:PDF;O'Reilly Product page:http\\://shop.oreilly.com/product/1491912766.do:URL;Amazon Search inside:http\\://www.amazon.de/gp/reader/1491912766/:URL;Related Web Site:http\\://spark.apache.org/:URL", "isbn": "978-1-4919-7295-3", "groups": "public", "intrahash": "ae554cd588aa5098f61836d33a83991b", "timestamp": "2017.07.01", "username": "flint63", "bibtexKey": "RyzaLasersonEtAl17"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/277726bdcc815404c58e0e9874f89af47/indc", "tags": ["imported"], "intraHash": "77726bdcc815404c58e0e9874f89af47", "interHash": "d6a3a4d2c458d205e8800adcd8de4b76", "label": "Library of Recommended Evaluated Neutron Data (BROND)", "user": "indc", "description": "", "date": "2010-12-04 16:55:32", "changeDate": "2010-12-04 16:55:38", "count": 1, "pub-type": "techreport", "year": "1986", "url": "http://www-nds.iaea.org/reports-new/indc-reports/indc-ccp/indc-ccp-0261.pdf", "author": [" Various"], "authors": [{"first": "", "last": "Various"}], "number": "INDC(CCP)-261", "note": "See document for author list.

However, they have all used different data models for structuring their bibliographic data. Some are using a FRBR-based model with several layers of entities while others use flat, record-oriented data models. The proliferation of data models limits the reusability of bibliographic data. In effect, libraries have moved from MARC silos to Linked Data silos of incompatible data models. Data sets can be difficult to combine and reuse. Small modelling differences may be overcome by schema mappings, but it is not clear that interoperability has improved overall. We present a survey of published bibliographic Linked Data, the data models proposed for representing bibliographic data as RDF, and tools used for conversion from MARC. Also, the approach of the National Library of Finland is discussed.Seit einiger Zeit stellen Bibliotheken ihre bibliografischen Metadadaten verst\u00e4rkt offen in Form von Linked Data zur Verf\u00fcgung. Dabei kommen jedoch ganz unterschiedliche Modelle f\u00fcr die Strukturierung der bibliografischen Daten zur Anwendung. Manche Bibliotheken verwenden ein auf FRBR basierendes Modell mit mehreren Schichten von Entit\u00e4ten, w\u00e4hrend andere flache, am Datensatz orientierte Modelle nutzen. Der Wildwuchs bei den Datenmodellen erschwert die Nachnutzung der bibliografischen Daten. Im Ergebnis haben die Bibliotheken die fr\u00fcheren MARC-Silos nur mit zueinander inkompatiblen Linked-Data-Silos vertauscht. Deshalb ist es h\u00e4ufig schwierig, Datensets miteinander zu kombinieren und nachzunutzen. Kleinere Unterschiede in der Datenmodellierung lassen sich zwar durch Schema Mappings in den Griff bekommen, doch erscheint es fraglich, ob die Interoperabilit\u00e4t insgesamt zugenommen hat. Der Beitrag stellt die Ergebnisse einer Studie zu verschiedenen ver\u00f6ffentlichten Sets von bibliografischen Daten vor. Dabei werden auch die unterschiedlichen Modelle betrachtet, um bibliografische Daten als RDF darzustellen, sowie Werkzeuge zur Erzeugung von entsprechenden Daten aus dem MARC-Format.

In a reversible data embedding scheme, in the process of achieving reversibility and embedding the data, it induces some distortions into marked image/video. If the distortions in marked image are random due to reversible embedding, it may not reveal much information about the existence of hidden data; on the contrary, if the distortions are repetitive geometric patterns which arises when an embedding scheme's emphasis is on capacity and reversibility, then the marked media with geometric distortions may reveal the existence of the hidden data. Further, in applications involving satellite images, medical, military, fine arts images, etc. which involves reversible embedding, it requires to show the details for inspection. Due to repetitive geometric distortions as in 6 and 7, the visual quality of image degrades. Hence, there is a need for enhancing the reversibly embedded images. To tackle this issue, if any exiting image enhancement scheme is used, it incur in loss of hidden data as well as the restoration of image to original form is not possible; hence, violating the requirement of reversibility for such applications. To address this problem we propose a reversible image enhancement scheme for reversibly data embedded images by using HVS characteristics of DCT. The experimental results show that the visual quality has been improved in terms of PSNR, PSNR-HVS, PSNR-HVS-M, and MSSIM when compared to S. Gujjunoori et al. scheme 6 and S. Gujjunoori et al. scheme 7, which contains repetitive geometrical distortions in marked media.", "language": "English", "issn": "1985-2304", "bibtexKey": "dhupppe2017reversible"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2477219bd0a22cdf232e9dcfd7b78b674/soeren", "tags": ["lod2page", "lehmann", "group_aksw", "2014", "dllearner", "MOLE"], "intraHash": "477219bd0a22cdf232e9dcfd7b78b674", "interHash": "66a6d782062b615d9b4fa141ceb2473a", "label": "Test-driven Evaluation of Linked Data Quality", "user": "soeren", "description": "", "date": "2017-01-27 23:28:47", "changeDate": "2017-01-27 23:30:12", "count": 7, "pub-type": "inproceedings", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World Wide Web", "year": "2014", "url": "http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2014/WWW_Databugger/public.pdf", "author": ["Dimitris Kontokostas", "Patrick Westphal", "S\u00f6ren Auer", "Sebastian Hellmann", "Jens Lehmann", "Roland Cornelissen", "Amrapali J.

Evaluation and optimisation of these methods is crucial to guide methodological choices. Simulating error-free data or taking high-quality data to qualify methods is common practice. Here, we emphasise the methodology of the \u2018virtual ecologist\u2019 (VE) approach where simulated data and observer models are used to mimic real species and how they are \u2018virtually\u2019 observed. This virtual data is then subjected to statistical analyses and modelling, and the results are evaluated against the \u2018true\u2019 simulated data. The VE approach is an intuitive and powerful evaluation framework that allows a quality assessment of sampling protocols, analyses and modelling tools. It works under controlled conditions as well as under consideration of confounding factors such as animal movement and biased observer behaviour. In this review, we promote the approach as a rigorous research tool, and demonstrate its capabilities and practical relevance. We explore past uses of VE in different ecological research fields, where it mainly has been used to test and improve sampling regimes as well as for testing and comparing models, for example species distribution models. We discuss its benefits as well as potential limitations, and provide some practical considerations for designing VE studies.

However, flexible integration of these methods into configurations best suited to the research question is hampered by heterogeneous file formats and monolithic software development. The mzXML, mzData, and mzML file formats have enabled uniform access to unprocessed raw data. In this paper we present our efforts to produce an equally simple and powerful format, PeakML, to uniformly exchange processed intermediary and result data. To demonstrate the versatility of PeakML, we have developed an open source Java toolkit for processing, filtering, and annotating mass spectra in a customizable pipeline (mzMatch), as well as a user-friendly data visualization environment (PeakML Viewer). The PeakML format in particular enables the flexible exchange of processed data between software created by different groups or companies, as we illustrate by providing a PeakML-based integration of the widely used XCMS package with mzMatch data processing tools. As an added advantage, downstream analysis can benefit from direct access to the full mass trace information underlying summarized mass spectrometry results, providing the user with the means to rapidly verify results.

To address this question, we performed hybridization-capture enrichment and multiplexed Illumina NGS for 27 cancer-related genes using DNA from 16 paired fresh-frozen and routine FFPE lung adenocarcinoma specimens and conducted extensive comparisons between the sequence data from each sample type. This analysis revealed small but detectable differences between FFPE and frozen samples. Compared with frozen samples, NGS data from FFPE samples had smaller library insert sizes, greater coverage variability, and an increase in C to T transitions that was most pronounced at CpG dinucleotides, suggesting interplay between DNA methylation and formalin-induced changes; however, the error rate, library complexity, enrichment performance, and coverage statistics were not significantly different. Comparison of base calls between paired samples demonstrated concordances of >99.99%, with 96.8% agreement in the single-nucleotide variants detected and >98% accuracy of NGS data when compared with genotypes from an orthogonal single-nucleotide polymorphism array platform. This study demonstrates that routine processing of FFPE samples has a detectable but negligible effect on NGS data and that these samples can be a reliable substrate for clinical NGS testing.", "pmid": "23810758", "doi": "10.1016/j.jmoldx.2013.05.004", "bibtexKey": "Spencer:2013:J-Mol-Diagn:23810758"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2c2e6cef4fb9c9752b5ba277abc5856ad/wt08_triple_stores", "tags": ["wt08", "grahsl_tieber"], "intraHash": "c2e6cef4fb9c9752b5ba277abc5856ad", "interHash": "e96224a35176a92b098b4d355361ada5", "label": "Scalable Semantic Web Data Management Using Vertical Partitioning", "user": "wt08_triple_stores", "description": "", "date": "2008-11-17 16:58:57", "changeDate": "2011-09-22 16:39:24", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "year": "2007", "url": "", "author": [" Abadi", " Marcus", " Madden", " Hollenbach"], "authors": [{"first": "", "last": "Abadi"}, {"first": "", "last": "Marcus"}, {"first": "", "last": "Madden"}, {"first": "", "last": "Hollenbach"}], "abstract": "Efficient management of RDF data is an important factor in realizing\r\nthe Semantic Web vision.

A host of ontologies and metadata standards exist in the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain: CIDOC CRM, TEI5, LIDO, SPECTRUM, VRA Core, MPEG7, DC, ESE and EDM, OAI ORE and PMH, IIIIF, ResourceSync... the list goes on and on. How many of the standards listed in Seeing Standards: A Visualization of the Metadata Universe (by Jenn Riley, Associate Dean for Digital Initiatives at McGill University Library) apply to your work? A number of established thesauri and gazetteers exist, and some of them are interconnected: DBPedia; Wikidata, VIAF, FAST, ULAN; GeoNames, Pleiades, TGN; LCSH, AAT, IconClass, Joconde, SVCN, Wordnet, etc etc. The diagram below (by Michiel Hildebrand) shows a small part of this upcoming universe of CH data. How to use them in every-day collection management, cataloging, documentation and research? How to expose your institution's collections and other data to allow interlinking? Digital Humanities (DH) has emerged as a new and promising scientific discipline, with universities like Kings College London establishing new departments devoted to it. As Jeffrey Schnapp writes in the Digital Humanities manifesto 2.0 \"Digital Humanities embraces and harnesses the expanded, global nature of today\u2019s research communities as one of the great inter-disciplinary/post-disciplinary opportunities of our time. It dreams of models of knowledge production and reproduction that leverage the increasingly distributed nature of expertise and knowledge and transform this reality into occasions for scholarly innovation, disciplinary cross-fertilization, and the democratization of knowledge\". In his keynote address at MCN 2014 Beyond Borders: The Humanities in the Digital Age, James Cuno (President and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust) emphasizes the role of modernizing Humanities and the value of Linked Data in cultural heritage informatics. The question also is how to preserve the role of libraries, museums and other Cultural Heritage institutions as centers of wisdom and culture into the new millennium? Aren't Google, Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter and smart-phone apps becoming the new centers of research and culture (or at least popular culture)? We believe the answers to many of these questions lie with Semantic Technology and Linked Data. They enable large-scale Digital Humanities research, collaboration and aggregation; and technological renewal of CH institutions. The Rosetta Stone was key to the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphs, by providing parallel text in three scripts: Ancient Egyptian, Demotic and Ancient Greek. Today semantic technologies play a similar role, allowing the Digital Humanist to make connections between (and make sense of) the multitude of digitized cultural artifacts available on the net. An upsurge of interest in semantic technology has swept the CH and DH communities. Meetups and summits, conferences and un-conferences, residences and hackathons are taking place every week. CH institutions are collaborating actively. An active Linked Open Data for Libraries, Archives and Museums (LODLAM) community has emerged, and the #LODLAM twitter hashtag sees active communication. Established institutions create branches that sound like web startups or Wikipedia offsprings (e.g. British Library Labs; Smithsonian Web-strategy and Smithsonian Commons; UK National Archives department of Web Continuity). The Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) sector deals with complex and varied data. Integrating that data, especially across institutions, has always been a challenge. On the other hand, the value of linked data is especially high in this sector, since culture by its very nature is cross-border and interlinked. In this webinar we'll present interesting LODLAM projects, datasets and ontologies, as well as Ontotext's experience in this domain.", "url_pdf": "http://rawgit2.com/VladimirAlexiev/my/master/pres/20160929-webinar/Linked%20Open%20Data%20for%20Cultural%20Heritage.pdf", "url_recording": "https://ontotext.com/knowledgehub/webinars/build-narratives-connect-artifacts-cultural-heritage/", "url_slides": "http://rawgit2.com/VladimirAlexiev/my/master/pres/20160929-webinar/index.html", "url_html": "http://rawgit2.com/VladimirAlexiev/my/master/pres/20160929-webinar/index-full.html", "bibtexKey": "Alexiev2016-CH-webinar"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2659b28c735105397e7bdfceda9d95d3b/flint63", "tags": ["paper", "data", "ai", "spatial", "analysis", "user", "v1500", "interface", "springer", "temporal"], "intraHash": "659b28c735105397e7bdfceda9d95d3b", "interHash": "e3c49c68b0b6b34c89a18c1c66be8d76", "label": "A Visual Analytics Framework for Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Modelling", "user": "flint63", "description": "", "date": "2013-06-08 17:36:11", "changeDate": "2018-04-16 11:45:55", "count": 2, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "year": "2013", "url": "", "author": ["Natalia Andrienko", "Gennady Andrienko"], "authors": [{"first": "Natalia", "last": "Andrienko"}, {"first": "Gennady", "last": "Andrienko"}], "volume": "27", "number": "1", "pages": "55-83", "abstract": "To support analysis and modelling of large amounts of spatio-temporal data having the form of spatially referenced time series (TS) of numeric values, we combine interactive visual techniques with computational methods from machine learning and statistics.

The framework includes interactive visual interfaces to a library of modelling methods supporting the selection of a suitable method, adjustment of model parameters, and evaluation of the models obtained. The models can be externally stored, communicated, and used for prediction and in further computational analyses. From the visual analytics perspective, the framework suggests a way to externalize spatio-temporal patterns emerging in the mind of the analyst as a result of interactive visual analysis: the patterns are represented in the form of computer-processable and reusable models. From the statistical analysis perspective, the framework demonstrates how TS analysis and modelling can be supported by interactive visual interfaces, particularly, in a case of numerous TS that are hard to analyse individually.

Minimax lower bounds are\r\nobtained and this classification rule is shown to be simultaneously rate\r\noptimal over a collection of parameter spaces. In addition, we consider\r\nclassification with incomplete data under the missing completely at random\r\n(MCR) model. An adaptive classifier with theoretical guarantees is introduced\r\nand optimal rate of convergence for high-dimensional linear discriminant\r\nanalysis under the MCR model is established. The technical analysis for the\r\ncase of missing data is much more challenging than that for the complete data.\r\nWe establish a large deviation result for the generalized sample covariance\r\nmatrix, which serves as a key technical tool and can be of independent\r\ninterest.

One of these general purpose statistical packages is SPSS, which includes a very flexible and powerful procedure for fitting LMMs to longitudinal data sets with continuous outcomes.

The term Big Scholarly Data is coined for the rapidly growing scholarly data, which contains information including millions of authors, papers, citations, figures, tables, as well as scholarly networks and digital libraries. Nowadays, various scholarly data can be easily accessed and powerful data analysis technologies are being developed, which enable us to look into science itself with a new perspective. In this paper, we examine the background and state of the art of big scholarly data. We first introduce the background of scholarly data management and relevant technologies. Second, we review data analysis methods, such as statistical analysis, social network analysis, and content analysis for dealing with big scholarly data. Finally, we look into representative research issues in this area, including scientific impact evaluation, academic recommendation, and expert finding. For each issue, the background, main challenges, and latest research are covered. These discussions aim to provide a comprehensive review of this emerging area.

In such studies, multi-state models can be used to model the movement of patients among the various states. In these models issues, of interest include the estimation of progression rates, assessing the effects of individual risk factors, survival rates or prognostic forecasting. In this article, we review modelling approaches for multi-state models, and we focus on the estimation of quantities such as the transition probabilities and survival probabilities. Differences between these approaches are discussed, focussing on possible advantages and disadvantages for each method. We also review the existing software currently available to fit the various models and present new software developed in the form of an R library to analyse such models. Different approaches and software are illustrated using data from the Stanford heart transplant study and data from a study on breast cancer conducted in Galicia, Spain.", "pmid": "18562394", "doi": "10.1177/0962280208092301", "bibtexKey": "MeiraMachado:2009:Stat-Methods-Med-Res:18562394"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2b1ea2bb0abe0d8c5ee076be9980a19fd/alexjdl", "tags": ["InformationIntegration"], "intraHash": "b1ea2bb0abe0d8c5ee076be9980a19fd", "interHash": "a85723140aa84c8947a473aeec1bd26c", "label": "Triplify - Light-Weight Linked Data Publication from Relational Databases", "user": "alexjdl", "description": "", "date": "2009-12-16 14:33:13", "changeDate": "2009-12-16 14:33:13", "count": 9, "pub-type": "inproceedings", "booktitle": "18th International World Wide Web Conference", "year": "2009", "url": "http://www2009.eprints.org/63/", "author": ["S\u00f6ren Auer", "Sebastian Dietzold", "Jens Lehmann", "Sebastian Hellmann", "David Aumueller"], "authors": [{"first": "S\u00f6ren", "last": "Auer"}, {"first": "Sebastian", "last": "Dietzold"}, {"first": "Jens", "last": "Lehmann"}, {"first": "Sebastian", "last": "Hellmann"}, {"first": "David", "last": "Aumueller"}], "pages": "621--621", "abstract": "In this paper we present Triplify ? a simplistic but effective approach to publish Linked Data from relational databases. Triplify is based on mapping HTTP-URI requests onto relational database queries. Triplify transforms the resulting relations into RDF statements and publishes the data on the Web in various RDF serializations, in particular as Linked Data. The rationale for developing Triplify is that the largest part of information on the Web is already stored in structured form, often as data contained in relational databases, but usually published by Web applications only as HTML mixing structure, layout and content. In order to reveal the pure structured information behind the current Web, we have implemented Triplify as a light-weight software component, which can be easily integrated into and deployed by the numerous, widely installed Web applications. Our approach includes a method for publishing update logs to enable incremental crawling of linked data sources. Triplify is complemented by a library of con?gurations for common relational schemata and a REST-enabled data source registry. Triplify con?gurations containing mappings are provided for many popular Web applications, including osCommerce, WordPress, Drupal, Gallery, and phpBB. We will show that despite its light-weight architecture Triplify is usable to publish very large datasets, such as 160GB of geo data from the OpenStreetMap project.", "bibtexKey": "www200963"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/245e260622e3a7f65113aeccc9045257e/brusilovsky", "tags": ["log-mining,", "www"], "intraHash": "45e260622e3a7f65113aeccc9045257e", "interHash": "cce5aba2bf874ccc0d6b950a8e1c50cc", "label": "Discovering Web Access Patterns and Trends by Applying OLAP and Data Mining Technology on Web Logs", "user": "brusilovsky", "description": "", "date": "2017-11-15 17:02:25", "changeDate": "2017-11-15 17:02:25", "count": 3, "pub-type": "inproceedings", "booktitle": "ADL '98: Proceedings of the Advances in Digital Libraries Conference", "publisher": "IEEE Computer Society", "address": "Washington, DC, USA", "year": "1998", "url": "http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=785951", "author": ["Osmar R.

Despite many improvements over the past decades, air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3) pose still one of the major risks to human health and the environment. Based on both a general analysis of the air quality situation and regulations in the EU and Germany as well as an in-depth analysis of local management practices requirements for better decision making are identified. The requirements are used to outline a system architecture following a co-design approach, i.e., besides scientific and industry partners, local experts and administrative actors are actively involved in the system development. Additionally, the outlined system incorporates two novel methodological strands: (1) it employs a deep neural network (DNN) based data analytics approach and (2) makes use of a new generation of satellite data, namely Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P). Hence, the system allows for providing areal and high-resolution (e.g., street-level) real-time and forecast (up to 48 hours) data to inform decision makers for taking appropriate short-term measures, and secondly, to simulate air quality under different planning options and long-term actions such as modified traffic flows and various urban layouts.", "bibtexKey": "petry2020quality"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/245e260622e3a7f65113aeccc9045257e/aho", "tags": ["www", "log-mining"], "intraHash": "45e260622e3a7f65113aeccc9045257e", "interHash": "cce5aba2bf874ccc0d6b950a8e1c50cc", "label": "Discovering Web Access Patterns and Trends by Applying OLAP and Data Mining Technology on Web Logs", "user": "aho", "description": "", "date": "2018-03-19 12:24:51", "changeDate": "2018-03-19 12:24:51", "count": 3, "pub-type": "inproceedings", "booktitle": "ADL '98: Proceedings of the Advances in Digital Libraries Conference", "publisher": "IEEE Computer Society", "address": "Washington, DC, USA", "year": "1998", "url": "http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=785951", "author": ["Osmar R.

Here, we address this problem by building a neural\r\nnetwork emulator that provides the linear theory matter power spectrum in about\r\none millisecond with 0.3% accuracy over $10^-3 k h\\,Mpc^-1 <\r\n30$. We train this emulator with more than 150,000 measurements, spanning a\r\nbroad cosmological parameter space that includes massive neutrinos and\r\ndynamical dark energy.

Complementing this emulator, we train 15\r\nother emulators for the cross-spectra of various linear fields in Eulerian\r\nspace, as predicted by 2nd-order Lagrangian Perturbation theory, which can be\r\nused to accelerate perturbative bias descriptions of galaxy clustering.

Big data is tending to establish as a very important research field. This paper aims to explore the evolution, growth and scientific collaboration of the Indian publications in the field of big data.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach: A survey approach is used in the study while data for the study is collected from Scopus database for the year 2001 to 2015. Bibliometric analysis, visualization and mapping software are used to present the current status, growth trends and collaboration in big data research to examine its diffusion in Indian scientific literature.\n\nFindings: We found that the big data research in India is gaining momentum and its diffusion and adoption is increasing tremendously. Conference and seminars are used to do social connect and interaction within the research community. The collaboration at institution level is found usual while collaboration at international level is low. Application of big data in health sciences and life sciences is yet to be explored in comparison to the social sciences and physical sciences.\n\nOriginality/ Value: This paper presents the growth, trends and collaboration in big data literature by the use of sophisticated bibliometric software and visualization software.", "shorttitle": "Diffusion of Big Data in Indian Scientific Literature", "bibtexKey": "singh_diffusion_2017"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2e919f54682a245a2c2e4b76aa44e11e0/cmcneile", "tags": ["data,", "statistics"], "intraHash": "e919f54682a245a2c2e4b76aa44e11e0", "interHash": "1d5881cc5e25df0d7264a18941b706ea", "label": "HEPData: a repository for high energy physics data", "user": "cmcneile", "description": "", "date": "2019-02-23 22:09:48", "changeDate": "2019-02-23 22:15:27", "count": 2, "pub-type": "misc", "year": "2017", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05473", "author": ["Eamonn Maguire", "Lukas Heinrich", "Graeme Watt"], "authors": [{"first": "Eamonn", "last": "Maguire"}, {"first": "Lukas", "last": "Heinrich"}, {"first": "Graeme", "last": "Watt"}], "abstract": "The Durham High Energy Physics Database (HEPData) has been built up over the\npast four decades as a unique open-access repository for scattering data from\nexperimental particle physics papers.

In the context of linked data, key organizational components are the RDF data model, element schemas and value vocabularies, with simple ontologies having minimally defined classes and properties in order to facilitate reuse and interoperability. Simplicity over formal semantics is a tenet of the open-world assumption underlying ontology languages central to the Semantic Web, but the result is a lack of constraints, data quality checks and validation capacity. Inconsistent use of vocabularies and ontologies that do not follow formal semantics rules and logical concept hierarchies further complicate the use of Semantic Web technologies. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) helps make existing value vocabularies available in the linked data environment, but it exchanges precision for simplicity. Incompatibilities between simple organized vocabularies, Resource Description Framework Schemas and OWL ontologies and even basic notions of subjects and concepts prevent smooth translations and challenge the conversion of cultural institutions' unique legacy vocabularies for linked data.

Today, this schema information is added to the Infoset during schema-validation and commonly is referred to as PSVI contributions (PSVI for \"Post-Validation Schema Infoset\"). Utilizing schema information is promising, for XML Schema allows to describe relationships between structures in an expressive, semantically relevant way, e.g. through type derivation and substitution groups. This structural information can become valuable meta-data when processing instances that comply to the respective Schema. However, only a small fraction of this schema information is accessible with the aforementioned technologies. There are various reasons for this: Some schema information such as where wildcards can occur is not exposed at all, and other components (e.g. types) are only represented by QNames, lacking any possibilities to further navigate the schema information. Secondly, the PSVI specification remains vague with respect to the data model. And finally, the present data model of XML Schema is not appropriate for some application contexts. The existence of differing data models for XML Schema (e.g. in programming APIs for XML Schema) is evidence for the fact that the abstract data model as defined in the recommendation does not rule out the need for other data model perspectives. In fact, the abstract data model and its incarnations (namely the normative XML syntax) may be good for defining schemas, but it proves to be less appropriate for exploiting the structural information. Features that are convenient for definition (such as named groups and nested model groups) turn out to be problematic for retrieval and navigation, the most important ways of using the structural information. We propose an alternative data model perspective that represents the schema information in a way that meets the needs of certain classes of applications better. These applications have in common read-only access to schema information, an instance-driven perspective, the need for schema inspection at runtime, and possibly only a local scope. Our data model uses what we call \u00f6ccurrences\" instead of the \"particles\" in the normative abstract data model, and it expands what we (deliberately) consider to be notational shorthands (like occurrence constraints and named groups). Furthermore, we index all occurrences (even of the same element), as it is done in \"marked expressions\" in regular language theory. The structural information is not longer captured by model groups, but by a set of potential next occurrences. This is based on the idea of Brzozowski derivatives and again inspired by the anticipated needs of instance-oriented applications. We present a prototype implementation which is purely based on standard technologies. It is implemented as a XSLT 2.0 function library that reads schemas in the normative XML syntax, constructs the data model from this information, and provides various functions for accessing, navigating, and exploiting the schema information. We show that such functionality is highly beneficial, making applications more powerful, resilient, and easier to develop.", "topic": "scx0.9 spath0.8", "uri": "http://dret.net/netdret/publications#wil07h", "bibtexKey": "wil07h"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/21c9d1be99bbd133b499cfef49ff594b2/lepsky", "tags": ["terminologieextraktion"], "intraHash": "1c9d1be99bbd133b499cfef49ff594b2", "interHash": "cac955282c2d8d570bd2221bac49efb3", "label": "An approach for named entity recognition in poorly structured data", "user": "lepsky", "description": "", "date": "2018-11-04 16:54:56", "changeDate": "2018-11-04 16:54:56", "count": 2, "pub-type": "inproceedings", "publisher": "Springer", "year": "2012", "url": "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/esws/eswc2012.html#FreireBC12", "author": ["Nuno Freire", "Jos\u00e9 Borbinha", "P\u00e1vel Calado"], "authors": [{"first": "Nuno", "last": "Freire"}, {"first": "Jos\u00e9", "last": "Borbinha"}, {"first": "P\u00e1vel", "last": "Calado"}], "editor": ["Elena Simperl", "Philipp Cimiano", "Axel Polleres", "\u00d3scar Corcho", "Valentina Presutti"], "editors": [{"first": "Elena", "last": "Simperl"}, {"first": "Philipp", "last": "Cimiano"}, {"first": "Axel", "last": "Polleres"}, {"first": "\u00d3scar", "last": "Corcho"}, {"first": "Valentina", "last": "Presutti"}], "volume": "7295", "pages": "718--732", "abstract": "This paper describes an approach for the task of named entity recog- nition in structured data containing free text as the values of its elements.

While early efforts to populate them with content have concentrated on the deposit of peer-reviewed research papers, there is a growing awareness of their potential as repositories of data and other non-text materials, and consequently a need to develop strategies and procedures that can realise this potential. Chemistry as a discipline has been slower than the physical and biomedical sciences to adopt and exploit Open Access concepts in the handling of experimental data and research publications. Chemical information is essential to many sciences outside chemistry, and the reporting of the synthesis and properties of new chemical compounds is central to this. But most of the essential experimental data associated with peer-reviewed publications from chemistry departments are never communicated to the scientific community. These data are all available in high-quality electronic form in the laboratories but there is no effective method for archiving them or making them openly accessible. The SPECTRa (Submission, Preservation, and Exposure of Chemistry Teaching and Research Data) project addressed this problem. It was a JISC-funded 18-month collaboration, ending in March 2007, between the university libraries and chemistry departments of the University of Cambridge and Imperial College London, in co-operation with the eBank-UK project. Its main objective was to develop a set of customized software tools that would enable chemists routinely to deposit experimental data in Open Access repositories, employing the DSpace repository platform used by the two libraries. The work was informed by surveys of research chemists in the two universities, exploring their use of information technology and assessing their interest in using repositories and Open Access principles for data management.

The\r\nrelative influence of collaboration data versus\r\ncontent data is not imposed as an exogenous pa-\r\nrameter, but rather emerges naturally from the\r\ngiven data sources. However, global probabilis-\r\ntic models coupled with standard EM learning al-\r\ngorithms tend to drastically overfit in the sparse-\r\ndata situations typical of recommendation appli-\r\ncations. We show that secondary content in-\r\nformation can often be used to overcome spar-\r\nsity. Experiments on data from the ResearchIn-\r\ndex library of Computer Science publications\r\nshow that appropriate mixture models incorpo-\r\nrating secondary data produce significantly better\r\nquality recommenders than\r\n \r\n-nearest neighbors\r\n(\r\n \r\n-NN). Global probabilistic models also allow\r\nmore general inferences than local methods like\r\n \r\n-NN.", "bibtexKey": "popescul2001pmu"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2c0311c57b5d8dbaabaf8d4bcedf91974/voss", "tags": ["researchdata", "library"], "intraHash": "c0311c57b5d8dbaabaf8d4bcedf91974", "interHash": "f97b3024d5e33a43abac7849212f7066", "label": "Scaling Research Data Management Services Along the Maturity Spectrum: Three Institutional Perspectives Preprint", "user": "voss", "description": "", "date": "2018-01-19 13:25:44", "changeDate": "2018-01-19 13:25:44", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "LIS Scholarship Archive", "year": "2018", "url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WZ8FN", "author": ["Cinthya Ippoliti", "Amy Koshoffer", "Renaine Julian", "Micah Vandegrift", "Devin Soper", "Sophie Meridien"], "authors": [{"first": "Cinthya", "last": "Ippoliti"}, {"first": "Amy", "last": "Koshoffer"}, {"first": "Renaine", "last": "Julian"}, {"first": "Micah", "last": "Vandegrift"}, {"first": "Devin", "last": "Soper"}, {"first": "Sophie", "last": "Meridien"}], "abstract": "Research data services promise to advance many academic libraries\u2019 strategic goals of becoming partners in the research process and integrating library services with modern research workflows.

In the age of industrial Internet of Things, a smart production unit can be perceived as a large connected industrial system of materials, parts, machines, tools, inventory, and logistics that can relay data and communicate with each other. While, traditionally, the focus has been on machine health and predictive maintenance, the manufacturing industry has also started focusing on analyzing data from the entire production line. These applications bring a new set of analytics challenges. Unlike traditional data mining analysis, which consists of lean datasets (that is, datasets with few features), manufacturing has fat datasets. In addition, previous approaches to manufacturing analytics restricted themselves to small time periods of data. The latest advances in big data analytics allows researchers to do a deep dive into years of data. Bosch collects and utilizes all available information about its products to increase its understanding of complex linear and nonlinear relationships between parts, machines, and assembly lines.

Despite these investments of time and money, we do not have a firm grasp of who openly shares raw research data, who doesn't, and which initiatives are correlated with high rates of data sharing. In this analysis I use bibliometric methods to identify patterns in the frequency with which investigators openly archive their raw gene expression microarray datasets after study publication. Automated methods identified 11,603 articles published between 2000 and 2009 that describe the creation of gene expression microarray data. Associated datasets in best-practice repositories were found for 25\\% of these articles, increasing from less than 5\\% in 2001 to 30\\%-35\\% in 2007-2009. Accounting for sensitivity of the automated methods, approximately 45\\% of recent gene expression studies made their data publicly available. First-order factor analysis on 124 diverse bibliometric attributes of the data creation articles revealed 15 factors describing authorship, funding, institution, publication, and domain environments. In multivariate regression, authors were most likely to share data if they had prior experience sharing or reusing data, if their study was published in an open access journal or a journal with a relatively strong data sharing policy, or if the study was funded by a large number of NIH grants.

An active Linked Open Data for Libraries, Archives and Museums (LODLAM) community exists, CH data is published as LOD, and international collaborations have emerged.

It starts with a brief overview of the information revolution and its consequences. It then briefly examines some of the arguments for the use of computers in schools in developing countries, before reviewing previous work undertaken on the costs of such provision. An analysis of this literature indicates that the costs of equipment (hardware and software) may account for only 16 to 20% of the total cost of computer provision (excluding salaries) over five years. The cost data gathered at school/telecenter level, as a part of this research, is then analyzed. A framework that yields data on housing, equipment, training, running and external support costs was developed and used to gather this data. The data is categorized into Basic, Basic plus and Deluxe provision. Basic and Basic plus provision use second-hand /refurbished equipment, with Basic plus provision also providing raining and support. Only Deluxe provision purchases new equipment. In addition to this, a rural school, community based telecenter provision and commercial provision are looked at. The data supplied is analyzed with various figures being produced for the different categories. The paper then raises other issues which can affect computer provision and utilization including the processes of allocating provision, training of teachers in the use of ICT and models of provision. Conclusions are then drawn and recommendations made. A glossary of acronyms and technical terms is provided. Eighteen tables are included. Appendixes include: efficiency calculations; centrally financed government provision; details of community-based telecenter provision supplied by the U.S.; adjustments made to data received; and reflections on this research and what can be learned for future research.

Recently, it has become customary to apply statistical bias correction to achieve better statistical correspondence to observational data. As climate model output should be interpreted as the space-time average over a given model grid box and output time step, the status quo in bias correction is to employ matching gridded observational data to yield optimal results. Here we show that when gridded observational data are not available, statistical bias correction can be carried out using point measurements, e.g., rain gauges. Our nonparametric method, which we call scale-adapted statistical bias correction (SABC), is achieved by data aggregation of either the available modeled or gauge data. SABC is a straightforward application of the well-known Taylor hypothesis of frozen turbulence. Using climate model and rain gauge data, we show that SABC performs significantly better than equal-time period statistical bias correction.", "issn": "1944-8007", "doi": "10.1002/2015GL063188", "bibtexKey": "GRL:GRL52699"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2a1a88dbfd48c72f8a52d18d057cb18d4/nichtich", "tags": ["myown", "data", "phd"], "intraHash": "a1a88dbfd48c72f8a52d18d057cb18d4", "interHash": "31ad32ae4506a9e9a6f3717d1a449737", "label": "Revealing digital documents.

The method, Hessian-based locally linear embedding, derives from a conceptual framework of local isometry in which the manifold M, viewed as a Riemannian submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space \u211dn, is locally isometric to an open, connected subset \u0398 of Euclidean space \u211dd. Because \u0398 does not have to be convex, this framework is able to handle a significantly wider class of situations than the original ISOMAP algorithm. The theoretical framework revolves around a quadratic form \u210b(f) = \u222bM\u2009\u2225Hf(m)\u2225dm defined on functions f : M \u21a6 \u211d. Here Hf denotes the Hessian of f, and \u210b(f) averages the Frobenius norm of the Hessian over M. To define the Hessian, we use orthogonal coordinates on the tangent planes of M. The key observation is that, if M truly is locally isometric to an open, connected subset of \u211dd, then \u210b(f) has a (d + 1)-dimensional null space consisting of the constant functions and a d-dimensional space of functions spanned by the original isometric coordinates. Hence, the isometric coordinates can be recovered up to a linear isometry. Our method may be viewed as a modification of locally linear embedding and our theoretical framework as a modification of the Laplacian eigenmaps framework, where we substitute a quadratic form based on the Hessian in place of one based on the Laplacian.", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1031596100", "eprint": "http://www.pnas.org/content/100/10/5591.full.pdf+html", "bibtexKey": "DG03"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2baf744e81f461eef0d2b4f095d7b2bbe/gpkulkarni", "tags": ["library"], "intraHash": "baf744e81f461eef0d2b4f095d7b2bbe", "interHash": "8b260967bd74b3b2712f9405dbddef62", "label": "Neutrino mass bounds from confronting an effective model with BOSS\r\n  Lyman-alpha data", "user": "gpkulkarni", "description": "Neutrino mass bounds from confronting an effective model with BOSS Lyman-alpha data", "date": "2020-11-09 07:49:27", "changeDate": "2020-11-09 07:49:27", "count": 1, "pub-type": "misc", "year": "2020", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03050", "author": ["Mathias Garny", "Thomas Konstandin", "Laura Sagunski", "Matteo Viel"], "authors": [{"first": "Mathias", "last": "Garny"}, {"first": "Thomas", "last": "Konstandin"}, {"first": "Laura", "last": "Sagunski"}, {"first": "Matteo", "last": "Viel"}], "note": "cite arxiv:2011.03050Comment: 27 pages, 11 figures", "abstract": "We present an effective model for the one-dimensional Lyman-$\\alpha$ flux\r\npower spectrum far above the baryonic Jeans scale.

The most common examples are stores, sets and arrays. We present an automatic method that generates finite counterexamples for wrong conjectures and therewith offers a valuable support for proof engineers saving their time otherwise spent on unsuccessful proof attempts. The approach is based on the finite model finding and uses Alloy Analyzer 1 to generate finite instances of theories in KIV 6. Most definitions of functions or predicates on infinite structures do not preserve the semantics if a transition to arbitrary finite substructures is made. We propose the constraints which should be satisfied by the finite substructures, identify a class of amenable definitions and present a practical realization using Alloy.

The collected DAMA/LIBRA data satisfy all the many peculiarities of the DM annual modulation signature. Neither systematic effects nor side reactions able to account for the observed modulation amplitude and to contemporaneously satisfy all the several requirements of this DM signature are available. Considering the former DAMA/NaI and the present DAMA/LIBRA data all together (total exposure 0.82 ton\u00d7yr), the presence of Dark Matter particles in the galactic halo is supported, on the basis of the DM annual modulation signature, at 8.2\u00a0\u03c3 C.L.; in particular, in the energy interval (2\u20136)\u00a0keV, the modulation amplitude is (0.0131\u00b10.0016)\u00a0cpd/kg/keV and the phase and the period are well compatible with June 2 nd  and one year, respectively.", "issn": "1434-6044", "issue": "3", "keyword": "Physics and Astronomy", "affiliation": "Universit\u00e0 di Roma \u201cTor Vergata\u201d Dipartimento di Fisica 00133 Rome Italy", "doi": "10.1140/epjc/s10052-008-0662-y", "bibtexKey": "springerlink:10.1140/epjc/s10052-008-0662-y"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/28b3f7f50cd8c7aa8a4f7972c6cdd427c/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "8b3f7f50cd8c7aa8a4f7972c6cdd427c", "interHash": "ef2ee76521461e189fc36f4e94dac980", "label": "Promoting Open Access to Scholarly Data: A Case Study of the Electronic Thesis and Dissertation (ETD) Project at the Simon Fraser University Library.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2020-06-30 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2020-07-01 11:48:47", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Data Sci.

These maps, which cover the $\\sim$2500 square degrees\r\nof the Southern sky imaged by the SPT-SZ survey, represent a significant\r\nimprovement over previous such products available in this region by virtue of\r\ntheir higher angular resolution (1.25 arcminutes for our highest resolution\r\nCompton-$y$ maps) and lower noise at small angular scales. In this work we\r\ndetail the construction of these maps using linear combination techniques,\r\nincluding our method for limiting the correlation of our lowest-noise\r\nCompton-$y$ map products with the cosmic infrared background.

To aid in development of CF-compliant software and to capture with a minimal set of elements all of the information contained in the CF conventions, we propose a formal data model for CF which is independent of netCDF and describes all possible CF-compliant data. Because such data will often be analysed and visualised using software based on other data models, we compare our CF data model with the ISO 19123 coverage model, the Open Geospatial Consortium CF netCDF standard, and the Unidata Common Data Model.

The redefinition of the traditional data models for cultural heritage resources into data models based on semantic technology has been a major activity of the cultural heritage community. Yet, linked data may bring new innovation opportunities for cultural heritage metadata aggregation. We present the outcomes of a case study that we conducted within the Europeana cultural heritage network. In this study, the National Library of The Netherlands contributed by providing the role of data provider, while the Dutch Digital Heritage Network contributed as an intermediary aggregator that aggregates datasets and provides them to Europeana, the central aggregator. We identified and analyzed the requirements for an aggregation solution for the linked data, guided by current aggregation practices of the Europeana network. These requirements guided the definition of a workflow that fulfils the same functional requirements as the existing one. The workflow was put into practice within this study and has led to the development of software applications for administrating datasets, crawling the web of data, harvesting linked data, data analysis and data integration. We present our analysis of the study outcomes and analyze the effort necessary, in terms of technology adoption, to establish a linked data approach, from the point of view of both data providers and aggregators.

Through exploration of data time series we develop a definition of a regime shift from a pragmatic perspective, in which a shift is considered as an abrupt change from a quantifiable ecosystem state. We conclude that such changes represent a restructuring of the ecosystem state in some substantial sense that persists for long enough that a new quasi-equilibrium state can be observed. The abruptness of the shift is relative to the life-scale or the reproductive time-scale of the higher predators that are influenced by the shift. In general, the event-forcing is external to the biological ecosystem, usually the physical climate system, but we also identify shifts that can be ascribed to anthropogenic forcing, in our examples fishing. This pragmatic definition allows for several different types of regime shift ranging from simple biogeographic shifts to non-linear state changes. In practice it is quite difficult to determine whether observed changes in an oceanic ecosystem are primarily spatial or temporally regulated. The determination of ecosystem state remains an unresolved, and imprecise, oceanographic problem. We review observations and interpretation from several different oceanic regions as examples to illustrate this pragmatic definition of a regime shift: the Northeast Pacific, the Northwest and Northeast Atlantic, and Eastern Boundary Currents.

However, the identification of session (termed often \u2018sessionization\u2019) is fraught with difficulty in that there is no way of determining from a transactional log file that a user has ended their session. No one logs out. Instead a session delimiter has to be applied and this is typically done on the basis of a standard period of inactivity. To date researchers have discussed the issue of a time out delimiter in terms of a single value and if a page view time exceeds the cut-off value the session is deemed to have ended. This approach assumes that page view time is a single distribution and that the cut-off value is one point on that distribution. The authors however argue that page time distribution is composed of a number of quite separate view time distributions because of the marked differences in view times between pages (abstract, contents page, full text). This implies that a number of timeout delimiters should be applied. Employing data from a study of the OhioLINK digital journal library, the authors demonstrate how the setting of a time out delimiter impacts on the estimate of page view time and the number of estimated session. Furthermore, they also show how a number of timeout delimiters might apply and they argue that this gives a better and more robust estimate of the number of sessions, session time and page view time compared to an application of a single timeout delimiter.", "issn": "0306-4573", "doi": "10.1016/j.ipm.2007.03.003", "bibtexKey": "huntington2008website"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/27670efd03f717db6502c70151a226b90/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "7670efd03f717db6502c70151a226b90", "interHash": "7cb92fe8bbdf1ca861e300eee7e41192", "label": "dsCleaner: A Python Library to Clean, Preprocess and Convert Non-Instrusive Load Monitoring Datasets.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2019-11-26 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2019-11-27 11:44:21", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Data", "year": "2019", "url": "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/data/data4.html#PereiraVP19", "author": ["Manuel Pereira", "Nuno Velosa", "Lucas Pereira"], "authors": [{"first": "Manuel", "last": "Pereira"}, {"first": "Nuno", "last": "Velosa"}, {"first": "Lucas", "last": "Pereira"}], "volume": "4", "number": "3", "pages": "123", "ee": "https://doi.org/10.3390/data4030123", "bibtexKey": "journals/data/PereiraVP19"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/204c1cd2bbdb77bd08c7da6772ff5e3d5/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "04c1cd2bbdb77bd08c7da6772ff5e3d5", "interHash": "200f6ff9cf92a7baa00866578a0d2f0f", "label": "The Ionic Liquid Property Explorer: An Extensive Library of Task-Specific Solvents.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2019-08-08 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2019-08-09 11:43:31", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Data", "year": "2019", "url": "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/data/data4.html#VenkatramanEL19", "author": ["Vishwesh Venkatraman", "Sigvart Evjen", "Kallidanthiyil Chellappan Lethesh"], "authors": [{"first": "Vishwesh", "last": "Venkatraman"}, {"first": "Sigvart", "last": "Evjen"}, {"first": "Kallidanthiyil Chellappan", "last": "Lethesh"}], "volume": "4", "number": "2", "pages": "88", "ee": "https://doi.org/10.3390/data4020088", "bibtexKey": "journals/data/VenkatramanEL19"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2ba57384bb672552353a4d6104dbb13f1/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "ba57384bb672552353a4d6104dbb13f1", "interHash": "d0dffa2c3c27e5d667cd1fd1ddf4c699", "label": "GasLib - A Library of Gas Network Instances.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2020-10-26 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2020-10-27 12:09:40", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Data", "year": "2017", "url": "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/data/data2.html#0003ABHJKKOPSSS17", "author": ["Martin Schmidt", "Denis A\u00dfmann", "Robert Burlacu", "Jesco Humpola", "Imke Joormann", "Nikolaos Kanelakis", "Thorsten Koch", "Djamal Oucherif", "Marc E.

The RSS 2.0 standard is used to place periodical tables of content (TOC) data into the library catalogue without human intervention, thus improving the accuracy of records, saving time for library administrators and adding value for library users. The project will build on the work that has already been done formulating the ONIX Serial Release Notice (SRN) format and the Publishing Requirements for Industry Standard Metadata (PRISM) standards. The objectives of the project are to: extend the RSS 2.0 standard to encompass relevant components of standards such as ONIX and Prism, and publish the resultant document in the public domain; use the extended RSS standard to provide a greater level of automation of interoperability between the publisher and a library through the integrated library system (ILS); deliver open source software components and Extensible Markup Language (XML) schemas, which will be freely available for the whole of the FE/HE library, publisher and ILS supplier communities; produce a demonstration implementation of a service utilising the standards and software as part of the project; and report on the impact of this project for an academic institution. The project was led by Emerald Group Publishing Ltd and Emerald's head of Web services, Paul Evans, is TOCRoSS project manager. The other partners are TALIS Information Ltd and Derby University, UK. When the project is complete, the software will be published via sourceforge (http: //sourceforge.net/), where a TOCRoSS project will be set up.

The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge aims to evaluate the success of GRN inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the inference of GRNs that was best performer in the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed GRNs, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for GRN inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.", "citeulike-article-id": "7933027", "citeulike-linkout-2": "http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20927193", "citeulike-linkout-1": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2946910/", "citeulike-linkout-3": "http://www.hubmed.org/display.cgi?uids=20927193", "pmid": "20927193", "priority": "2", "posted-at": "2010-10-18 11:45:12", "issn": "1932-6203", "citeulike-linkout-0": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012776", "pmcid": "PMC2946910", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0012776", "bibtexKey": "HuynhThu2010Inferring"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2ec376c72819bb5bf2fb5b2c97944bc73/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "ec376c72819bb5bf2fb5b2c97944bc73", "interHash": "e07f877b9308799ac7ff106cee1a59a4", "label": "Date Literacy as Requirement for China's Library and Information Profession: A Preliminary Research on Recruitment Data.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2018-02-06 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2018-02-07 11:35:24", "count": 1, "pub-type": "inproceedings", "booktitle": "ECIL", "series": "Communications in Computer and Information Science", "publisher": "Springer", "year": "2017", "url": "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ecil/ecil2017.html#ZhangLX17", "author": ["Jing Zhang", "Qianli Lin", "Peng Xiao"], "authors": [{"first": "Jing", "last": "Zhang"}, {"first": "Qianli", "last": "Lin"}, {"first": "Peng", "last": "Xiao"}], "editor": ["Serap Kurbanoglu", "Joumana Boustany", "Sonja Spiranec", "Esther Grassian", "Diane Mizrachi", "Loriene Roy"], "editors": [{"first": "Serap", "last": "Kurbanoglu"}, {"first": "Joumana", "last": "Boustany"}, {"first": "Sonja", "last": "Spiranec"}, {"first": "Esther", "last": "Grassian"}, {"first": "Diane", "last": "Mizrachi"}, {"first": "Loriene", "last": "Roy"}], "volume": "810", "pages": "186-194", "ee": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-74334-9_20", "isbn": "978-3-319-74334-9", "bibtexKey": "conf/ecil/ZhangLX17"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2f9a47a8d2b1996f3fe9702941767c926/acka47", "tags": ["opendata", "zeit.de", "libraries", "interview", "openbiblio"], "intraHash": "f9a47a8d2b1996f3fe9702941767c926", "interHash": "e4857651c9a2b416538b93b46122ceab", "label": "\u201cBibliotheken sollten ihre Daten \u00f6ffnen\u201d", "user": "acka47", "description": "", "date": "2011-11-11 21:29:20", "changeDate": "2011-12-04 21:33:53", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Data-Blog von ZEIT ONLINE", "year": "2011", "url": "http://blog.zeit.de/open-data/2011/11/08/open-bibliographic-data/", "author": ["Lorenz Matzat", "Adrian Pohl"], "authors": [{"first": "Lorenz", "last": "Matzat"}, {"first": "Adrian", "last": "Pohl"}], "bibtexKey": "pohl-2011-interview"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2eac8708d5df5fb2482c49f99c781ffdb/jaj", "tags": ["icpsr2012"], "intraHash": "eac8708d5df5fb2482c49f99c781ffdb", "interHash": "d7af824200e466c0f188d870fee97be4", "label": "Collecting Small Data", "user": "jaj", "description": "", "date": "2012-08-06 17:58:02", "changeDate": "2012-08-06 17:58:02", "count": 1, "pub-type": "techreport", "journal": "Research Library Issues", "year": "2011", "url": "http://publications.arl.org/1h7vog.pdf", "author": ["Karen Hogenboom", "Tom Teper", "Lynn Wiley"], "authors": [{"first": "Karen", "last": "Hogenboom"}, {"first": "Tom", "last": "Teper"}, {"first": "Lynn", "last": "Wiley"}], "abstract": "As noted in E-Science and Data Support Services, what we call big data only represents one part of the significant challenge that research libraries face in meeting changing data needs inourrespectivescholarlycommunities.3 Theacquisitionandmanagementof small data present particular challenges that require exploration as our institutions evolve to meet changing user needs.

This can be achieved with so-called\r\nsearch-term-recommenders (STR) that map free search terms of a lay user to\r\ncontrolled vocabulary terms which can then be used as a term suggestion or to\r\ndo an automatic query expansion (Hienert, Schaer, Schaible, & Mayr, 2011).\r\nState-of-the-art repository software systems like DSpace or EPrints already\r\noffer some kind of term suggestion features in search or input forms but these\r\nimplementations only work as simple auto completion mechanisms that don't\r\nincorporate any kind of semantic mapping.

Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data.

We demonstrate, with SAS statistical software, applications in a study comparing baseline refractive error between one eye with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and the unaffected fellow eye, and in a study determining factors associated with visual field in the elderly.When refractive error from both eyes were analyzed with standard linear regression without accounting for inter-eye correlation (adjusting for demographic and ocular covariates), the difference between eyes with CNV and fellow eyes was 0.15 diopters (D; 95% confidence interval, CI -0.03 to 0.32D, p = 0.10). Using a mixed effects model or a marginal model, the estimated difference was the same but with narrower 95% CI (0.01 to 0.28D, p = 0.03). Standard regression for visual field data from both eyes provided biased estimates of standard error (generally underestimated) and smaller p-values, while analysis of the worse eye provided larger p-values than mixed effects models and marginal models.In research involving both eyes, ignoring inter-eye correlation can lead to invalid inferences. Analysis using only right or left eyes is valid, but decreases power. Worse-eye analysis can provide less power and biased estimates of effect. Mixed effects or marginal models using the eye as the unit of analysis should be used to appropriately account for inter-eye correlation and maximize power and precision.", "pmid": "28102741", "doi": "10.1080/09286586.2016.1259636", "bibtexKey": "Ying:2017:Ophthalmic-Epidemiol:28102741"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/27fa38f8e08686010744c218af29e8766/voss", "tags": ["researchdata"], "intraHash": "7fa38f8e08686010744c218af29e8766", "interHash": "ca94ed111af291aab2845d10501b59e2", "label": "Steal this idea: A library instructors\u2019 guide to educating students in data management skills", "user": "voss", "description": "", "date": "2014-09-10 08:31:33", "changeDate": "2014-09-10 08:31:33", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "College & Research Libraries News", "year": "2014", "url": "http://crln.acrl.org/content/75/8/431.full", "author": ["Lisa Johnston", "Jon Jeffryes"], "authors": [{"first": "Lisa", "last": "Johnston"}, {"first": "Jon", "last": "Jeffryes"}], "volume": "75", "number": "8", "pages": "431-434", "bibtexKey": "noauthororeditor"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "990", "tags": ["data_capture", "functional_requirements_analysis", "data_preservation", "data_use", "Scientific_data", "networked_sensing", "data_deluge", "carlysD1", "user_centered_design"], "intraHash": "3fd16e8df96dcaf5224f3e9e1a323413", "interHash": "0a7f00450c20e32d5e2ca990566016ee", "label": "Drowning in data: Digital library architecture to support scientific use of embedded sensor networks", "user": "cstrasser", "description": "", "date": "2010-11-18 23:10:33", "changeDate": "2010-11-18 23:10:33", "count": 2, "pub-type": "article", "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "address": "Vancouver, BC, Canada", "year": "2007", "url": "http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1255175.1255228", "author": ["Christine L.

The existing managing infrastructure is not yet suitable for the upcoming requirements and does not provide support for flexible and extensible data models for being future-proof. In this paper we present a system that uses the generic RDF resource management system OntoWiki for managing library resources. OntoWiki is extended by components for adapting the generic system to the given domain, e.g.~by using data templates. In addition the Linked Data capability of OntoWiki is used and extended to import various metadata to enrich the managing resource. Consequently using Linked Data further enables libraries to build up a Linked Data infrastructure in the library domain.", "owner": "natanael", "issn": "1617-5468", "isbn": "978-3-88579-626-8", "bdsk-url-1": "http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2014/DERM_AMSL/public.pdf", "bibtexKey": "nareike-a-2014--a"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2a6af0ae3ad7a707272604ffc1ed5e8c9/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "a6af0ae3ad7a707272604ffc1ed5e8c9", "interHash": "95e56bd77a78e76f86344d05467690ae", "label": "An Image Processing Library Based on Abstract Image Data-Types in C++.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2017-05-19 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2019-05-15 16:47:20", "count": 1, "pub-type": "inproceedings", "booktitle": "ICIAP", "series": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", "publisher": "Springer", "year": "1995", "url": "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iciap/iciap1995.html#KoelmaS95", "author": ["Dennis Koelma", "Arnold W.

We wrote mathscout to import data from a major program for ab initio computational chemistry into mathematica, so that we could postprocess the chemical results. It can be used to import the output of many other packages that are used, e.g. in molecular dynamics, crystallography, spectroscopic analysis, metabolic and physiological modeling, meteorology and other areas of environmental science, cosmology and particle physics. mathscout assigns a name to each table and non-tabular datum that it extracts. This name is constructed mechanically from the identifier or phrase that precedes or follows or embeds the item in the output that mathscout processes. A selection of non-contiguous items, or all the items in a section of the file, or in the entire file are extracted using simple commands. So far, we have focused on our immediate needs to postprocess the output of the Gaussian2 program.

Based on research in various domains including applied statistics, health informatics, data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence, database management, and digital libraries, significant advances have been achieved over the last decade in all aspects of the data matching process, especially on how to improve the accuracy of data matching, and its scalability to large databases.\r\n\r\nPeter Christen\u2019s book is divided into three parts: Part I, \u201cOverview\u201d, introduces the subject by presenting several sample applications and their special challenges, as well as a general overview of a generic data matching process. Part II, \u201cSteps of the Data Matching Process\u201d, then details its main steps like pre-processing, indexing, field and record comparison, classification, and quality evaluation. Lastly, part III, \u201cFurther Topics\u201d, deals with specific aspects like privacy, real-time matching, or matching unstructured data. Finally, it briefly describes the main features of many research and open source systems available today.\r\n\r\nBy providing the reader with a broad range of data matching concepts and techniques and touching on all aspects of the data matching process, this book helps researchers as well as students specializing in data quality or data matching aspects to familiarize themselves with recent research advances and to identify open research challenges in the area of data matching. To this end, each chapter of the book includes a final section that provides pointers to further background and research material. Practitioners will better understand the current state of the art in data matching as well as the internal workings and limitations of current systems. Especially, they will learn that it is often not feasible to simply implement an existing off-the-shelf data matching system without substantial adaption and customization. Such practical considerations are discussed for each of the major steps in the data matching process.", "isbn": "978-3-642-31163-5", "subtitle": "Concepts and Techniques for Record Linkage, Entity Resolution, and Duplicate Detection", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-31164-2", "urldate": "2018-03-07", "bibtexKey": "christen2012B"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/26070eefb0c2b84b6730c4b74f9fcc05b/aorchid", "tags": ["R", "markov"], "intraHash": "6070eefb0c2b84b6730c4b74f9fcc05b", "interHash": "d1603bc727dd26f093e16e78830ffa85", "label": "Multi-state models for the analysis of time-to-event data", "user": "aorchid", "description": "", "date": "2012-06-14 22:21:01", "changeDate": "2012-06-14 22:21:01", "count": 2, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Stat.

In such studies, multi-state models can be used to model the movement of patients among the various states. In these models issues, of interest include the estimation of progression rates, assessing the effects of individual risk factors, survival rates or prognostic forecasting. In this article, we review modelling approaches for multi-state models, and we focus on the estimation of quantities such as the transition probabilities and survival probabilities. Differences between these approaches are discussed, focussing on possible advantages and disadvantages for each method. We also review the existing software currently available to fit the various models and present new software developed in the form of an R library to analyse such models.

Owing to recent advances in methods and software, the mixed model analysis is now readily available to data analysts. The model is similar in many respects to ordinary multiple regression, but because it allows correlation between the observations, it requires additional work to specify models and to assess goodness-of-fit. The extra complexity involved is compensated for by the additional flexibility it provides in model fitting. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide readers with a sufficient introduction to the theory to understand the method and a more extensive discussion of model fitting and checking in order to provide guidelines for its use.

The present study aimed to propose a model for sustainable management in Iranian libraries. This research was a qualitative and applied study. In order to obtain the required data and information, deep and semi-structured interviews with twelve experts in the fields of information and knowledge science and sustainable development were used. The interviewees were selected by a purposeful sampling method. For data analysis using grounded theory methodology, the topics raised by interviewees were coded and categorized in three steps. Fifty-five concepts from the coding stage were classified into six subcategories. In the final paradigm of sustainable management, these subcategories were classified into context, intervening and causal conditions, strategies, and consequences, which act in relation to the main category of sustainable management in order to establish a green library.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Library up to March 2008, reference lists from pertinent articles, and searches of electronic citations. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective observational studies reporting characteristics of participants and non-participants approached for informed consent to use their medical records. Studies were selected independently in duplicate; a third reviewer resolved disagreements. DATA EXTRACTION: Age, sex, race, education, income, or health status of participants and non-participants, the participation rate in each study, and susceptibility of these calculations to threats of selection and reporting bias. RESULTS: Of 1650 citations 17 unique studies met inclusion criteria and had analysable data. Across all outcomes there were differences between participants and non-participants; however, there was a lack of consistency in the direction and the magnitude of effect. Of 161 604 eligible patients, 66.9% consented to use of data from their medical records. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences between participants and non-participants may threaten the validity of results from observational studies that require consent for use of data from medical records. To ensure that legislation on privacy does not unduly bias observational studies using medical records, thoughtful decision making by research ethics boards on the need for mandatory consent is necessary.", "pmid": "19282440", "issn": "1756-1833", "doi": "10.1136/bmj.b866", "bibtexKey": "Kho2009"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/27169540b5ee90401a9c943fcc079acbf/gpkulkarni", "tags": ["library"], "intraHash": "7169540b5ee90401a9c943fcc079acbf", "interHash": "8e23a5b304cf964c863f547fba0f4efb", "label": "Joint analysis of DES Year 3 data and CMB lensing from SPT and Planck\r\n  II: Cross-correlation measurements and cosmological constraints", "user": "gpkulkarni", "description": "Joint analysis of DES Year 3 data and CMB lensing from SPT and Planck II: Cross-correlation measurements and cosmological constraints", "date": "2022-03-24 09:53:22", "changeDate": "2022-03-24 09:53:22", "count": 1, "pub-type": "misc", "year": "2022", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12440", "author": ["C.

Such\r\ncross-correlations are also expected to be immune to some of the systematic\r\neffects that complicate correlation measurements internal to galaxy surveys. We\r\npresent measurements and modeling of the cross-correlations between galaxy\r\npositions and galaxy lensing measured in the first three years of data from the\r\nDark Energy Survey with CMB lensing maps derived from a combination of data\r\nfrom the 2500 deg$^2$ SPT-SZ survey conducted with the South Pole Telescope and\r\nfull-sky data from the Planck satellite. The CMB lensing maps used in this\r\nanalysis have been constructed in a way that minimizes biases from the thermal\r\nSunyaev Zel'dovich effect, making them well suited for cross-correlation\r\nstudies. The total signal-to-noise of the cross-correlation measurements is\r\n23.9 (25.7) when using a choice of angular scales optimized for a linear\r\n(nonlinear) galaxy bias model. We use the cross-correlation measurements to\r\nobtain constraints on cosmological parameters. For our fiducial galaxy sample,\r\nwhich consist of four bins of magnitude-selected galaxies, we find constraints\r\nof $\u00d8mega_m = 0.27^+0.03_-0.05$ and $S_8 \\sigma_8\r\n\u00d8mega_m/0.3= 0.74^+0.03_-0.04$ ($\u00d8mega_m =\r\n0.25^+0.03_-0.04$ and $S_8 = 0.73^+0.04_-0.03$) when assuming linear\r\n(nonlinear) galaxy bias in our modeling. Considering only the cross-correlation\r\nof galaxy shear with CMB lensing, we find $\u00d8mega_m= 0.27^+0.04_-0.06$\r\nand $S_8= 0.74^+0.03_-0.04$. Our constraints on $S_8$ are consistent with\r\nrecent cosmic shear measurements, but lower than the values preferred by\r\nprimary CMB measurements from Planck.", "bibtexKey": "chang2022joint"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/272e3e48f8d5af4937b8b8102d3b5508c/lepsky", "tags": ["data_librarian", "bibliotheken"], "intraHash": "72e3e48f8d5af4937b8b8102d3b5508c", "interHash": "d1515ed564a382cc0029d909cafc89e5", "label": "Data Librarian : das moderne Berufsbild", "user": "lepsky", "description": "", "date": "2018-11-04 17:00:37", "changeDate": "2018-11-04 17:00:37", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "B.I.T. online", "year": "216", "url": "http://www.b-i-t-online.de/heft/2016-02-fachbeitrag-hapke.pdf", "author": ["Henrike Hapke"], "authors": [{"first": "Henrike", "last": "Hapke"}], "volume": "19", "number": "2", "pages": "159--164", "abstract": "Der Arbeitsalltag einer Bibliothekarin bzw. eines Bibliothekars wird zunehmend gepr\u00e4gt von Datenmanagement, wodurch sich neue Berufsrichtungen entwickeln und neue Berufsbezeichnungen entstehen wie die des Data Librarian, Data Curator, Data Scientist, Data Analyst und Data Manager.

To speed up its application exploration, we propose a toolkit named LwTool for the data processing, including: (a) a feature library, including 1830 ready-to-use temporal and spatial features, (b) a hierarchical feature selection framework that automatically picks out the best features for a new application from the feature library. As real-time processing capability is important for instant user feedback, we emphasize not only on good recognition result but also on reducing time cost when selecting features. Our library and algorithms are validated on Smart-Toy and Smart-Bedsheet applications, an 89.7% accuracy for Smart-Toy and an 83.8% accuracy for Smart-Bedsheet can be achieved (10-fold cross-validation) using our feature library. Adopting the feature selection algorithm, the processing speed is increased by more than 3 times while maintaining high accuracy for both two applications.

Data were collected by an email survey and sent to 792 academic researchers and doctoral students. Total response rate was 18\\% (N = 139). The measurement instrument consisted of six sets of questions: about data management plans, the assignment of additional information to research data, about metadata, standard file naming systems, training at data management methods and the storing of research data.Findings The main finding is that knowledge about the procedures of data management is limited, and data management is not a normal practice in the researcher's work. They were, however, in general, of the opinion that the university should take the lead by recommending and offering access to the necessary tools of data management. Taken together, the results indicate that there is an urgent need to increase the researcher's understanding of the importance of data management that is based on professional knowledge and to provide them with resources and training that enables them to make effective and productive use of data management methods.Research limitations/implications The survey was sent to all members of the population but not a sample of it. Because of the response rate, the results cannot be generalized to all researchers at the university. Nevertheless, the findings may provide an important understanding about their research data procedures, in particular what characterizes their knowledge about data management and attitude towards it.Practical implications Awareness of these issues is essential for information specialists at academic libraries, together with other units within the universities, to be able to design infrastructures and develop services that suit the needs of the research community. The findings can be used, to develop data policies and services, based on professional knowledge of best practices and recognized standards that assist the research community at data management.Originality/value The study contributes to the existing literature about research data management by examining the results by participants' field of research. Recognition of the issues is critical in order for information specialists in collaboration with universities to design relevant infrastructures and services for academics and doctoral students that can promote their research data management.", "issn": "2050-3806", "doi": "10.1108/AJIM-04-2020-0110", "bibtexKey": "agusta2021literacy"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/281168cd20c45cfae0f244c56ca9fe8f5/gpkulkarni", "tags": ["library"], "intraHash": "81168cd20c45cfae0f244c56ca9fe8f5", "interHash": "be584e3f403e40a2bafac7ec9148f293", "label": "PypeIt: The Python Spectroscopic Data Reduction Pipeline", "user": "gpkulkarni", "description": "PypeIt: The Python Spectroscopic Data Reduction Pipeline", "date": "2020-05-15 08:58:49", "changeDate": "2020-05-15 08:58:49", "count": 1, "pub-type": "misc", "year": "2020", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06505", "author": ["J.

This new study examines the validity of the RDA core sets in more depth, employing think-aloud usability testing techniques and sets of typical bibliographic tasks, to gauge which of all the RDA elements are the most critical in a university library context.\nThe results provide guidance on the adoption of the RDA standard and its elements, and on the value of fully implementing the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) and Functional Requirements for Authority Data (FRAD) models on which RDA is based.", "date-added": "2012-04-09 02:26:49 +0000", "date-modified": "2012-08-03 11:13:22 +0000", "bdsk-url-1": "http://www.information-online.com.au/sb%5C_clients/iog/bin/iog%5C_programme%5C_2011%5C_A4.cfm?vm%5C_key=20EBCB11-1422-0982-EB23F88AA441A732", "bibtexKey": "Hider:2011rr"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2c1717a62eb076ba908e2f57813dfe3cb/jabreftest", "tags": ["methods;Stress", "Algorithms;AlternativeSplicing", "genetics;Arabidopsis", "RNA", "genetics;BaseSequence;Chi-SquareDistribution;ComputationalBiology", "Plant;Genes", "Genetic;MolecularSequenceData;ProteinIsoforms", "Plant;LinearModels;Models", "NucleicAcid;GeneExpressionRegulation", "analysis/genetics;SequenceAnalysis", "methods;ComputerSimulation;Databases", "Physiological"], "intraHash": "c1717a62eb076ba908e2f57813dfe3cb", "interHash": "53e24799efe8bcc1964caf995b4e7f93", "label": "Towards reliable isoform quantification using RNA-SEQ data.", "user": "jabreftest", "description": "", "date": "2010-12-31 02:55:47", "changeDate": "2010-12-31 02:55:47", "count": 2, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "year": "2010", "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-S3-S6", "author": ["Brian E Howard", "Steffen Heber"], "authors": [{"first": "Brian E", "last": "Howard"}, {"first": "Steffen", "last": "Heber"}], "volume": "11 Suppl 3", "pages": "S6", "note": "Seqmap is used as alignment tool which might be slow.

Here we explore the use of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets to address the isoform quantification problem. Given a set of known splice variants, the goal is to estimate the relative abundance of the individual variants. METHODS: Our method employs a linear models framework to estimate the ratios of known isoforms in a sample. A key feature of our method is that it takes into account the non-uniformity of RNA-Seq read positions along the targeted transcripts. RESULTS: Preliminary tests indicate that the model performs well on both simulated and real data. In two publicly available RNA-Seq datasets, we identified several alternatively-spliced genes with switch-like, on/off expression properties, as well as a number of other genes that varied more subtly in isoform expression. In many cases, genes exhibiting differential expression of alternatively spliced transcripts were not differentially expressed at the gene level. CONCLUSIONS: Given that changes in isoform expression level frequently involve a continuum of isoform ratios, rather than all-or-nothing expression, and that they are often independent of general gene expression changes, we anticipate that our research will contribute to revealing a so far uninvestigated layer of the transcriptome. We believe that, in the future, researchers will prioritize genes for functional analysis based not only on observed changes in gene expression levels, but also on changes in alternative splicing.", "pii": "1471-2105-11-S3-S6", "medline-pst": "epublish", "pmid": "20438653", "file": "Howard2010.pdf:Howard2010.pdf:PDF", "language": "eng", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-11-S3-S6", "bibtexKey": "Howard2010"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2a12f44a5805acda66f9f0e7dee802ffb/jkd", "tags": ["LongitudinalDataAnalysis", "statistics"], "intraHash": "a12f44a5805acda66f9f0e7dee802ffb", "interHash": "bd72ce36121c565f517791c0a0e29f24", "label": "A comparison of traditional approaches to hierarchical linear modeling when analyzing longitudinal data", "user": "jkd", "description": "A comparison of traditional approaches to hierarchical linear modeling when analyzing longitudinal data. - PubMed - NCBI", "date": "2018-09-21 02:31:33", "changeDate": "2018-09-21 02:31:33", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Res Nurs Health", "year": "1999", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10520194", "author": ["Y W Wu", "R R Clopper", "P J Wooldridge"], "authors": [{"first": "Y W", "last": "Wu"}, {"first": "R R", "last": "Clopper"}, {"first": "P J", "last": "Wooldridge"}], "volume": "22", "number": "5", "pages": "421-432", "abstract": "Longitudinal designs typically involve repeated time-ordered observations for each individual (or unit).

This architecture ensures that digital objects can be easily migrated from archive to archive over time and that the objects can, in principle, be made usable again at any point in the future; its primary benefit is that it serves as a fallback strategy against, and as a foundation for, more sophisticated (and costly) preservation strategies.

The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio\r\ntelescope was built with the detection of this signal as one of its major\r\nscience goals. One of the most significant challenges towards a successful\r\ndetection is that of calibration, especially in the presence of the Earth's\r\nionosphere. By introducing refractive source shifts, distorting source shapes\r\nand scintillating flux densities, the ionosphere is a major nuisance in\r\nlow-frequency radio astronomy.

Although statistical methods have remained largely fixed in a linear view of biology and behavior, more recent methods, such as the general linear mixed model (mixed model), can be used to analyze dynamic phenomena that are often of interest to nurses. Two strengths of the mixed model are (1) the ability to accommodate missing data points often encountered in longitudinal datasets and (2) the ability to model nonlinear, individual characteristics. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the advantages of using the mixed model for analyzing nonlinear, longitudinal datasets with multiple missing data points by comparing the mixed model to the widely used repeated measures ANOVA using an experimental set of data.

In this paper, we consider issues relevant in the design of biomedical studies in which the goal is the discovery of a subset of features and an associated algorithm that can predict a binary outcome, such as disease status. We compare the performance of four commonly used classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Prediction Analysis for Microarrays, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines) in high-dimensionality data settings. We evaluate the effects of varying levels of signal-to-noise ratio in the dataset, imbalance in class distribution and choice of metric for quantifying performance of the classifier. To guide study design, we present a summary of the key characteristics of 'omics' data profiled in several human or animal model experiments utilizing high-content mass spectrometry and multiplexed immunoassay based techniques.RESULTS:The analysis of data from seven 'omics' studies revealed that the average magnitude of effect size observed in human studies was markedly lower when compared to that in animal studies. The data measured in human studies were characterized by higher biological variation and the presence of outliers. The results from simulation studies indicated that the classifier Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM) had the highest power when the class conditional feature distributions were Gaussian and outcome distributions were balanced. Random Forests was optimal when feature distributions were skewed and when class distributions were unbalanced. We provide a free open-source R statistical software library (MVpower) that implements the simulation strategy proposed in this paper.CONCLUSION:No single classifier had optimal performance under all settings.

Our implementation relies on the construction of OpenFOAM\r\napplications that have bindings to data analysis libraries in Python. Double\r\nprecision data in OpenFOAM is cast to a NumPy array using the NumPy C-API and\r\nPython modules may then be used for arbitrary data analysis and manipulation on\r\nflow-field information. We highlight how the proposed wrapper may be used for\r\nan in-situ online singular value decomposition (SVD) implemented in Python and\r\naccessed from the OpenFOAM solver PimpleFOAM. Here, `in-situ' refers to a\r\nprogramming paradigm that allows for a concurrent computation of the data\r\nanalysis on the same computational resources utilized for the partial\r\ndifferential equation solver. In addition, to demonstrate data-parallel\r\nanalyses, we deploy a distributed SVD, which collects snapshot data across the\r\nranks of a distributed simulation to compute the global left singular vectors.\r\nCrucially, both OpenFOAM and Python share the same message passing interface\r\n(MPI) communicator for this deployment which allows Python objects and\r\nfunctions to exchange NumPy arrays across ranks. Subsequently, we provide\r\nscaling assessments of this distributed SVD on multiple nodes of Intel\r\nBroadwell and KNL architectures for canonical test cases such as the large eddy\r\nsimulations of a backward facing step and a channel flow at friction Reynolds\r\nnumber of 395. Finally, we demonstrate the deployment of a deep neural network\r\nfor compressing the flow-field information using an autoencoder to demonstrate\r\nan ability to use state-of-the-art machine learning tools in the Python\r\necosystem.", "bibtexKey": "maulik2021pythonfoam"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2504f50a31ad5e70f0f5eee4e48cba6bc/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "504f50a31ad5e70f0f5eee4e48cba6bc", "interHash": "0a7f00450c20e32d5e2ca990566016ee", "label": "Drowning in data: digital library architecture to support scientific use of embedded sensor networks.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2018-11-14 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2018-11-15 16:51:13", "count": 2, "pub-type": "inproceedings", "booktitle": "JCDL", "publisher": "ACM", "year": "2007", "url": "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/jcdl/jcdl2007.html#BorgmanWMP07", "author": ["Christine L.

Examples include periodontal disease study, where the measurements related to the disease status of each tooth are collected over time for each patient, which can be considered as a cluster. For such applications, the number of teeth for each patient may be related to the overall oral health of the individual and hence may influence the distribution of the outcome measure of interest leading to an informative cluster size. Under such situations, generalised estimating equations (GEE) may lead to invalid inferences. In this article, we investigate the performance of three competing proposals of fitting marginal linear models to clustered longitudinal data, namely, GEE, within-cluster resampling (WCR) and cluster-weighted generalised estimating equations (CWGEE). We show by simulations and theoretical calculations that, when the cluster size is informative, GEE provides biased estimators, while both WCR and CWGEE achieve unbiasedness under a variety of 'working' correlation structures for temporal measurements within each subject. Statistical properties of confidence intervals have been investigated using the probability-probability plots. Overall, CWGEE appears to be the recommended choice for marginal parametric inference with clustered longitudinal data that achieves similar parameter estimates and test statistics as WCR while avoiding Monte Carlo computation. The corresponding Wald tests have desirable power properties as well. We illustrate our analysis using a temporal data set on periodontal disease, which clearly demonstrates the need for CWGEE over GEE.", "pmid": "20223781", "doi": "10.1177/0962280209347043", "bibtexKey": "Wang:2011:Stat-Methods-Med-Res:20223781"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/20031b64557af1cd06e96769ff2b9177a/cirrus", "tags": ["library_2.0", "LibraryThing", "OPAC", "social_tagging"], "intraHash": "0031b64557af1cd06e96769ff2b9177a", "interHash": "c826711233844e4ab248bf44f2b78213", "label": "Subjecting the catalog to tagging", "user": "cirrus", "description": "", "date": "2009-03-08 16:14:46", "changeDate": "2009-03-08 16:14:46", "count": 3, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Library Hi Tech", "year": "2009", "url": "http://www.emeraldinsight.com/0737-8831.htm ", "author": ["Luiz H.

With the use of descriptive survey research design and purposive sampling technique questionnaire which was the sole instrument for data collection for the research was administered to 15 librarians in University of Buea Library. When subjected to descriptive statistical analysis, the collected data revealed that mutilation, theft, hiding of books and answering of phone calls were among principal crimes disrupting proper librarianship in University of Buea Library. Consequently, it was recommended that rules and regulations prohibiting the acts of making answering of mobile telephone calls, mutilation, theft and hiding of library books should be strictly implemented.

A\n                 program was developed that, instead of combining linear\n                 systems, evolves nonlinear ordinary differential\n                 equations to describe a system. The solution space was\n                 increased by using this approach. Automatically defined\n                 functions were used to represent the ordinary\n                 differential equations.\n\n                 A new way was introduced to speed up the evolution of\n                 genetic trees. The genetic trees representing the\n                 equations were written in C notation to a file to be\n                 compiled by a C compiler and evaluated by the computer.\n                 This required modifications to the Genetic Programming\n                 kernel formerly used. The modifications facilitated\n                 evaluation of a complete generation at one time to\n                 minimise compiler overhead. In order to build up a C++\n                 class hierarchy, the kernel was completely\n                 restructured. A lot of features like shrink mutation,\n                 variable tournament size, improved deme handling etc.\n                 were also added. A parameter study was carried out to\n                 investigate the influence of important control\n                 parameters.\n\n                 The Genetic Programming system was applied to a known,\n                 nonlinear system to verify its ability. After this\n                 proved to be successful, the input/output response data\n                 of a helicopter engine was used to identify that\n                 system.

However, most available EASM predictions are limited to seasonal to interannual scales, with indistinctive improvements. This study significantly improves decadal prediction skills of the 10\u2010year\u2010averaged EASM index (EASMI) and related decadal variations of the East China summer precipitation anomalies (ECSPAs) in the ten\u2010member decadal prediction experiments started once a year from 1960 to 2005 using a coupled climate model. These improvements are mainly attributed to the use of more realistic and well\u2010balanced initial conditions (ICs) from a weakly coupled data assimilation system that incorporates the monthly mean atmospheric reanalysis data into the model using the dimension\u2010reduced projection four\u2010dimensional variational data assimilation approach, a kind of four\u2010dimensional ensemble\u2010variational hybrid method. The atmospheric initialization ameliorates the ICs of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) through the air\u2010sea coupling, and thus leads to better PDO hindcasts and forecasts (under the representative concentration pathway 4.5). The improved PDO hindcasts (forecasts) result in more accurate hindcasts (forecasts) of land\u2010sea thermal contrast, and thus have significant impacts on the EASMI. The improved decadal predictions of the EASMI then contribute to the ameliorated prediction on decadal variations of the spatial distribution of ECSPAs. This study highlights the importance of ICs for a coupled model in reasonably presenting decadal variabilities of the EASMI.", "doi": "10.1002/joc.7141", "bibtexKey": "li2021improved"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/278a336f388beb8819911a62f5f8f46c8/kw", "tags": ["sorting", "algorithmen", "seminar", "distributed", "kde", "2010"], "intraHash": "78a336f388beb8819911a62f5f8f46c8", "interHash": "78035fc29c553328d1761ba69dd557da", "label": "Scalable Distributed-Memory External Sorting", "user": "kw", "description": "", "date": "2010-04-21 14:52:24", "changeDate": "2010-04-21 14:52:24", "count": 2, "pub-type": "inproceedings", "booktitle": "26th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, March 1-6, 2010, Long Beach, California, USA", "publisher": "IEEE Computer Society", "year": "2010", "url": "http://arxiv4.library.cornell.edu/pdf/0910.2582v1", "author": ["Mirko Rahn", "Peter Sanders", "Johannes Singler"], "authors": [{"first": "Mirko", "last": "Rahn"}, {"first": "Peter", "last": "Sanders"}, {"first": "Johannes", "last": "Singler"}], "editor": ["International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)"], "editors": [{"first": "International Conference", "last": "on Data Engineering (ICDE)"}], "pages": "685-688", "bibtexKey": "rahn2010scalable"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/23883b85a842f1e1f990080252bcf1825/raphael.goetz", "tags": ["myown", "raphaelgoetz", "thesis_supervised_by_sss_member", "sss-group"], "intraHash": "3883b85a842f1e1f990080252bcf1825", "interHash": "5e3faf8335c0545a4558fc585d7bfa91", "label": "Ensuring Integrity of NVMe Offloaded Data in Large-Scale Machine Learning", "user": "raphael.goetz", "description": "", "date": "2023-08-29 15:28:12", "changeDate": "2023-08-29 15:54:22", "count": 1, "pub-type": "mastersthesis", "year": "2023", "url": "", "author": ["Raphael G\u00f6tz", "Torsten Krau\u00df", "Alexandra Dmitrienko"], "authors": [{"first": "Raphael", "last": "G\u00f6tz"}, {"first": "Torsten", "last": "Krau\u00df"}, {"first": "Alexandra", "last": "Dmitrienko"}], "abstract": "Machine learning is increasingly used in security-critical domains and therefore has become\r\nan attractive target for attackers. In a targeted poisoning attack, the machine learning\r\nmodel is trained to behave normally on benign input, however, when a certain trigger is\r\npresent in the input, an attacker-chosen misbehavior is triggered. At the same time, neural\r\nnetworks are constantly increasing in size, especially in the natural language processing\r\ndomain, because more parameters can achieve higher accuracy. In recent years, there have\r\nbeen impressive innovations that have led to networks such as the Megatron-Turing NLG\r\n530B with 530 billion parameters. DeepSpeed is an open-source deep learning optimization\r\nlibrary that enables the training of such large networks. One of many innovations it\r\nimplements is a Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) offload that increases memory\r\nefficiency by moving data from expensive GPU and CPU memory to cheap NVMe memory.\r\nHowever, this mechanism opens a potential attack surface that could be exploited to\r\nperform poisoning attacks. Therefore, this thesis investigates the security of the NVMe\r\noffload mechanism and improves it. To achieve this, first, untargeted poisoning attack\r\nscenarios are tested to show that the NVMe offload is actually vulnerable. Then a security\r\nextension, able to guarantee the integrity and freshness of the data offloaded to the NVMe\r\nis designed and extensively evaluated. During this process, various trade-offs between\r\nsecurity and performance impact are carefully considered through the implementation and\r\nbenchmarking of several different versions of the extension. Based on the experimental\r\nresults, the security extension is then further improved. Furthermore, this thesis also\r\ninvestigates if multithreading and the use of previously generated hash tables can reduce\r\nthe performance impact.", "bibtexKey": "noauthororeditor"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2901c68daf79e4e71f9ddaef84ada3838/gpkulkarni", "tags": ["library"], "intraHash": "901c68daf79e4e71f9ddaef84ada3838", "interHash": "e33783a0aa1f682f1237e40fb84d7499", "label": "A Real Time Processing System for Big Data in Astronomy: Applications to\r\n  HERA", "user": "gpkulkarni", "description": "A Real Time Processing System for Big Data in Astronomy: Applications to HERA", "date": "2021-04-12 12:13:54", "changeDate": "2021-04-12 12:13:54", "count": 1, "pub-type": "misc", "year": "2021", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03990", "author": ["Paul La Plante", "Peter K.

The RTP system consists of analysis routines run on raw data\r\nshortly after they are acquired, such as calibration and detection of\r\nradio-frequency interference (RFI) events. RTP works closely with the\r\nLibrarian, the HERA data storage and transfer manager which automatically\r\ningests data and transfers copies to other clusters for post-processing\r\nanalysis. Both the RTP system and the Librarian are public and open source\r\nsoftware, which allows for them to be modified for use in other scientific\r\ncollaborations.

Large radio telescopes have been constructed for\r\nthis purpose, and in recent years there has been considerable progress in\r\ntransforming 21 cm cosmology from a field of considerable theoretical promise\r\nto one of observational reality. Increasingly, practitioners in the field are\r\ncoming to the realization that the success of observational 21cm cosmology will\r\nhinge on software algorithms and analysis pipelines just as much as it does on\r\ncareful hardware design and telescope construction. This review provides a\r\npedagogical introduction to state-of-the-art ideas in 21 cm data analysis,\r\ncovering a wide variety of steps in a typical analysis pipeline, from\r\ncalibration to foreground subtraction to mapmaking to power spectrum estimation\r\nto parameter estimation.", "bibtexKey": "liu2019analysis"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/20ad8e8bf5e1dc24105470a1e0c7ed39b/merlo", "tags": ["bibliodocs"], "intraHash": "0ad8e8bf5e1dc24105470a1e0c7ed39b", "interHash": "b8f3f43050fa78352604ee4a9b0df78f", "label": "Big data analysis of public library operations and services by using the Chernoff face method", "user": "merlo", "description": "", "date": "2018-06-06 10:57:26", "changeDate": "2018-06-06 10:58:21", "count": 2, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Journal of Documentation", "year": "2017", "url": "http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/JD-08-2016-0098", "author": ["Young-seok Kim", "Louise Cooke"], "authors": [{"first": "Young-seok", "last": "Kim"}, {"first": "Louise", "last": "Cooke"}], "volume": "73", "number": "3", "pages": "466--480", "issn": "0022-0418", "doi": "10.1108/JD-08-2016-0098", "bibtexKey": "Kim2017a"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/24893c8bb25306213b8077dbb67f3ee44/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "4893c8bb25306213b8077dbb67f3ee44", "interHash": "e274e000b8a87b31b6e85a61d2f9ce2c", "label": "A Discretization Algorithm of Numerical Attributes for Digital Library Evaluation Based on Data Mining Technology.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2017-05-26 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2019-05-15 14:44:47", "count": 1, "pub-type": "inproceedings", "booktitle": "ICADL", "series": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", "publisher": "Springer", "year": "2011", "url": "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icadl/icadl2011.html#ZhaoNPD11", "author": ["Yumin Zhao", "Zhendong Niu", "Xueping Peng", "Lin Dai"], "authors": [{"first": "Yumin", "last": "Zhao"}, {"first": "Zhendong", "last": "Niu"}, {"first": "Xueping", "last": "Peng"}, {"first": "Lin", "last": "Dai"}], "editor": ["Chunxiao Xing", "Fabio Crestani", "Andreas Rauber"], "editors": [{"first": "Chunxiao", "last": "Xing"}, {"first": "Fabio", "last": "Crestani"}, {"first": "Andreas", "last": "Rauber"}], "volume": "7008", "pages": "70-76", "ee": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-24826-9_12", "isbn": "978-3-642-24825-2", "bibtexKey": "conf/icadl/ZhaoNPD11"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/26db1490cfe8a220fc5da0ba699165c1c/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "6db1490cfe8a220fc5da0ba699165c1c", "interHash": "4c71584148f3c0d7a09794de3bf7d2e5", "label": "Empirical performance model-driven data layout optimization and library call selection for tensor contraction expressions.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2020-02-22 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2020-02-25 12:50:19", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "J.

Analyzing a novel firm-level business survey data set, we provide new insights on the price setting behavior of German retailers during a low inflation period. Relating the probability of both price and pricing plan adjustment to time- and state-dependent variables, we find that state-dependence is important; the macroeconomic environment as well as the firm-specific condition significantly determines the timing of both actual price changes and pricing plan adjustments. Moreover, input cost changes are important determinants of price setting. Finally, price increases respond more strongly to cost shocks compared to price decreases.", "issn": "1468-0475", "doi": "10.1111/geer.12011", "bibtexKey": "GEER:GEER12011"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2573a119676200b7e59c3fbf8b555a22c/wdees", "tags": ["kollaboration", "forschungsdaten", "bibliothek", "digitalisierung", "politikwissenschaft"], "intraHash": "573a119676200b7e59c3fbf8b555a22c", "interHash": "6cf7f5c57968e16c839b5d70c666549d", "label": "Digitization, Data Curation, and Human Rights Documents: Case Study of a Library-Researcher-Practitioner Collaboration", "user": "wdees", "description": "", "date": "2016-09-21 09:54:25", "changeDate": "2016-09-21 09:54:25", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "IASSIST Quarterly", "year": "2016", "url": "http://www.iassistdata.org/sites/default/files/vol_40_1_barton.pdf", "author": ["Amy Barton", "Paul Bracke", "Ann Clark"], "authors": [{"first": "Amy", "last": "Barton"}, {"first": "Paul", "last": "Bracke"}, {"first": "Ann", "last": "Clark"}], "volume": "40", "number": "1", "pages": "27-34", "bibtexKey": "barton2016digitization"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/26fe53f88735e0c5010a04756babf6eb8/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "6fe53f88735e0c5010a04756babf6eb8", "interHash": "5afff9eed26a78b2457b7828110e1e6b", "label": "Migration of data from one library management system to another: a case study in India.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2017-04-17 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2017-04-18 11:36:17", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Program", "year": "2005", "url": "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/program/program39.html#MatoriaU05", "author": ["Ram Kumar Matoria", "P.

The paper is a conceptual piece based on an exploratory literature review, targeting librarians interested in AI from a strategic rather than a technical perspective. Five distinct types of use cases of AI are identified for libraries, each with its own underlying drivers and barriers, and skills demands. They are applications in library back-end processes, in library services, through the creation of communities of data scientists, in data and AI literacy and in user management. Each of the different applications has its own drivers and barriers. It is hard to anticipate the impact on professional work but as information environment becomes more complex it is likely that librarians will continue to have a very important role, especially given AI\u2019s dependence on data.

This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF.

Earth Observation has considerably contributed to the development of methods for disaggregating population figures with higher resolution data into fine-grained population maps. However, which method is most suitable on the basis of the available data, and how the spatial units and accuracy metrics affect the validation process is not fully known. We aim to provide recommendations to researches that attempt to produce high-resolution population maps using remote sensing and geospatial information in heterogeneous urban landscapes. For this purpose, we performed a comprehensive experimental research on population disaggregation methods with thirty-six different scenarios. We combined five different top-down methods (from basic to complex, i.e., binary and categorical dasymetric, statistical, and binary and categorical hybrid approaches) on different subsets of data with diverse resolutions and degrees of availability (poor, average and rich). Then, the resulting population maps were systematically validated with a two-fold approach using six accuracy metrics. We found that when only using remotely sensed data the combination of statistical and dasymetric methods provide better results, while highly-resolved data require simpler methods. Besides, the use of at least three relative accuracy metrics is highly encouraged since the validation depends on level and method. We also analysed the behaviour of relative errors and how they are affected by the heterogeneity of the urban landscape. We hope that our recommendations save additional efforts and time in future population mapping.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0274504", "bibtexKey": "10.1371/journal.pone.0274504"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/282c13a8c7165f16f60978bf478104fd8/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "82c13a8c7165f16f60978bf478104fd8", "interHash": "43ff74912f9ed39203b7f785c1e3d6c2", "label": "Machine Learning and Big Data Processing for Cybersecurity Data Analysis.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2020-07-20 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2020-07-24 00:45:06", "count": 1, "pub-type": "incollection", "booktitle": "Data Science in Cybersecurity and Cyberthreat Intelligence", "series": "Intelligent Systems Reference Library", "publisher": "Springer", "year": "2020", "url": "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/series/isrl/isrl177.html#KotenkoSB20", "author": ["Igor V.

Semistructured data is becoming more and more prevalent, e.g., in structured documents such as HTML and when performing simple integration of data from multiple sources. Traditional data models and query languages are inappropriate, since semistructured data often is irregular: some data is missing, similar concepts are represented using different types, heterogeneous sets are present, or object structure is not fully known. Lorel is a user-friendly language in the SQL/OQL style for querying such data effectively. For wide applicability, the simple object model underlying Lorel can be viewed as an extension of the ODMG data model and the Lorel language as an extension of OQL. The main novelties of the Lorel language are: (i) the extensive use of coercion to relieve the user from the strict typing of OQL, which is inappropriate for semistructured data; and (ii) powerful path expressions, which permit a flexible form of declarative navigational access and are particularly suitable when the details of the structure are not known to the user. Lorel also includes a declarative update language. Lorel is implemented as the query language of the Lore prototype database management system at Stanford. Information about Lore can be found at http://www-db.stanford.edu/lore. In addition to presenting the Lorel language in full, this paper briefly describes the Lore system and query processor. We also briefly discuss a second implementation of Lorel on top of a conventional object-oriented database management system, the O2 system.", "issn": "1432-5012", "issue": "1", "keyword": "Computer Science", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94402, USA  abitebou,quass,mchughj,widom,wiener@db.stanford.edu http://www-db.stanford.edu", "doi": "10.1007/s007990050005", "bibtexKey": "springerlink:10.1007/s007990050005"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2f37650051ee8e003530ecdbfa62ce600/acka47", "tags": ["linkeddata", "myown", "ref", "MArbeit", "libraries"], "intraHash": "f37650051ee8e003530ecdbfa62ce600", "interHash": "45978c35875b00ef5e7d59cfa846fa12", "label": "Linked Data und die Bibliothekswelt", "user": "acka47", "description": "", "date": "2011-02-17 09:48:01", "changeDate": "2011-12-04 21:45:09", "count": 1, "pub-type": "misc", "year": "2011", "url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10760/15324", "author": ["Adrian Pohl"], "authors": [{"first": "Adrian", "last": "Pohl"}], "note": "Preprint.

Even though the emergence of Semantic Web technologies have produced the interest of Digital Repository providers to publish and enrich their content using Linked Data (LD) technologies, those institutions have used different generation approaches, and in certain cases ad-hoc solutions to solve particular use cases, but none of them has performed a comparison between existing approaches in order to demonstrate which one is the best solution prior to its application.

The AAM data are further cross validated with the independent observation of length\u2010of\u2010day (LOD). The intercomparison reveals a close agreement among almost all reanalysis data sets, except that the AAM computed from the 20th Century Reanalysis (20CR) has a noticeably lower correlation with LOD and with the AAM from other data sets. This reduced correlation is related to the absence of coherent low\u2010frequency variability, notably the Quasi\u2010biennial Oscillation, in the stratospheric zonal wind in 20CR. If the upper\u2010level zonal wind in 20CR is replaced by its counterpart from a different reanalysis data set, a higher value of the correlation is restored. The correlation between the AAM and the Nino3.4 index of tropical Pacific SST is also computed for the reanalysis data sets. In this case, a close agreement is found among all, including 20CR, data sets. This indicates that the upward influence of SST on the tropospheric circulation is well captured by the data assimilation system of 20CR, which only explicitly incorporated the surface observations. This study demonstrates the overall close agreement in the interannual variability of AAM among the reanalysis data sets. This finding also reinforces the view expressed in a recent work by the authors that the most significant discrepancies among the reanalysis data sets are in the long term mean and long\u2010term trend.", "doi": "10.1029/2012JD018105", "bibtexKey": "paek2012comparison"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2a21817946e7f84fbb085084d7297ee2c/jepcastel", "tags": ["Meta-AnalysisasTopic", "ReproducibilityofResults", "User-ComputerInterface", "Statistical", "Software", "DataInterpretation"], "intraHash": "a21817946e7f84fbb085084d7297ee2c", "interHash": "dff0d038b18096341f17c083369fa6bc", "label": "Meta-Analyst: software for meta-analysis of binary, continuous and diagnostic data.", "user": "jepcastel", "description": "", "date": "2023-02-03 11:44:35", "changeDate": "2023-02-03 11:44:35", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "BMC medical research methodology", "year": "2009", "url": "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2795760&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract", "author": ["Byron C Wallace", "Christopher H Schmid", "Joseph Lau", "Thomas A Trikalinos"], "authors": [{"first": "Byron C", "last": "Wallace"}, {"first": "Christopher H", "last": "Schmid"}, {"first": "Joseph", "last": "Lau"}, {"first": "Thomas A", "last": "Trikalinos"}], "volume": "9", "pages": "80", "note": "6213<m:linebreak></m:linebreak>LR: 20100928; GR: 290-02-0022/PHS HHS/United States; GR: R01HS018574/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States; GR: R33 RR17109/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States; JID: 100968545; OID: NLM: PMC2795760; 2009/04/30 received; 2009/12/04 accepted; 2009/12/04 aheadofprint; epublish;<m:linebreak></m:linebreak>Software estad\u00edstic; Metaan\u00e0lisi", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis is increasingly used as a key source of evidence synthesis to inform clinical practice. The theory and statistical foundations of meta-analysis continually evolve, providing solutions to many new and challenging problems. In practice, most meta-analyses are performed in general statistical packages or dedicated meta-analysis programs. RESULTS: Herein, we introduce Meta-Analyst, a novel, powerful, intuitive, and free meta-analysis program for the meta-analysis of a variety of problems. Meta-Analyst is implemented in C# atop of the Microsoft .NET framework, and features a graphical user interface. The software performs several meta-analysis and meta-regression models for binary and continuous outcomes, as well as analyses for diagnostic and prognostic test studies in the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. Moreover, Meta-Analyst includes a flexible tool to edit and customize generated meta-analysis graphs (e.g., forest plots) and provides output in many formats (images, Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word-ready RTF). The software architecture employed allows for rapid changes to be made to either the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or to the analytic modules.We verified the numerical precision of Meta-Analyst by comparing its output with that from standard meta-analysis routines in Stata over a large database of 11,803 meta-analyses of binary outcome data, and 6,881 meta-analyses of continuous outcome data from the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. Results from analyses of diagnostic and prognostic test studies have been verified in a limited number of meta-analyses versus MetaDisc and MetaTest. Bayesian statistical analyses use the OpenBUGS calculation engine (and are thus as accurate as the standalone OpenBUGS software). CONCLUSION: We have developed and validated a new program for conducting meta-analyses that combines the advantages of existing software for this task.", "city": "Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis, Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA 02111, USA. bwallace@tuftsmedicalcenter.org", "isbn": "1471-2288; 1471-2288", "pmid": "19961608", "issn": "1471-2288", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2288-9-80", "bibtexKey": "Wallace2009"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/29352984a602645581395c35b1e2218d7/wdees", "tags": ["forschungsdaten", "bibliothek"], "intraHash": "9352984a602645581395c35b1e2218d7", "interHash": "4bd0ea36698420c232e702ea6c2bba68", "label": "Supporting Research Data Management and Open Science in Academic Libraries: a Data Librarian's View", "user": "wdees", "description": "Unterst\u00fctzung von Forschungsdatenmanagement und offener Wissenschaft in wissenschaftlichen Bibliotheken: die Sicht eines Data Librarians | Mitteilungen der Vereinigung \u00d6sterreichischer Bibliothekarinnen und Bibliothekare", "date": "2020-01-06 12:31:37", "changeDate": "2020-01-06 12:31:37", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "Mitteilungen der Vereinigung \u00d6sterreichischer Bibliothekarinnen und Bibliothekare", "publisher": "Association of Austrian Librarians", "year": "2019", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31263%2Fvoebm.v72i2.3303", "author": ["Robin Rice"], "authors": [{"first": "Robin", "last": "Rice"}], "volume": "72", "number": "2", "pages": "263--273", "doi": "10.31263/voebm.v72i2.3303", "bibtexKey": "rice2019supporting"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2b90fa67c84b0cab26147f43cf51560f8/marcsaric", "tags": ["genomebrowser", "software", "open-source", "fulltext"], "intraHash": "b90fa67c84b0cab26147f43cf51560f8", "interHash": "7f5434a573eb600edf823ebe142eb7f2", "label": "Building a genome browser with GIVE", "user": "marcsaric", "description": "", "date": "2017-11-22 22:41:55", "changeDate": "2017-11-22 22:41:55", "count": 1, "pub-type": "article", "journal": "bioRxiv", "publisher": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "year": "2017", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/21/177832", "author": ["Xiaoyi Cao", "Zhangming Yan", "Qiuyang Wu", "Alvin Zheng", "Sheng Zhong"], "authors": [{"first": "Xiaoyi", "last": "Cao"}, {"first": "Zhangming", "last": "Yan"}, {"first": "Qiuyang", "last": "Wu"}, {"first": "Alvin", "last": "Zheng"}, {"first": "Sheng", "last": "Zhong"}], "abstract": "Genome browsers that manage, communicate and visualize data have greatly facilitated genomics research.

The article provides both conceptual and practical insight into the process of converting a legacy relational dataset to machine understandable semantic statements, a.k.a. 'triplification', and gives an overview of current software frameworks that can fulfill this goal. One important outcome of this effort and proof-of-concept is that a repository's content can be straightforwardly published as Linked Open Data. Another result is the ability to link to valuable external datasets, enabling a repository's data to become more contextualized and 'meaningful'. Finally, SPARQL querying shows the potential of triplifications to surpass the querying and use of local data.

Although several specialized statistical software programs of high quality are available that allow researchers to fit these models to longitudinal data sets (e.g., HLM), rapid advances in general purpose statistical software packages have recently enabled analysts to fit these same models when using preferred packages that also enable other more common analyses. One of these general purpose statistical packages is SPSS, which includes a very flexible and powerful procedure for fitting LMMs to longitudinal data sets with continuous outcomes. This article aims to present readers with a practical discussion of how to analyze longitudinal data using the LMMs procedure in the SPSS statistical software package.", "city": "University of Michigan-Ann, Arbor, USA. bwest@umich.edu", "isbn": "0163-2787", "pmid": "19679634", "issn": "0163-2787", "doi": "10.1177/0163278709338554", "bibtexKey": "West2009"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/28345a6c673f126e93fdc974d86991723/dblp", "tags": ["dblp"], "intraHash": "8345a6c673f126e93fdc974d86991723", "interHash": "4db3961d0169dbd6cc26af62ab4b253b", "label": "SemwidgJS: A Semantic Widget Library for the Rapid Development of User Interfaces for Linked Open Data.", "user": "dblp", "description": "", "date": "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "changeDate": "2020-07-24 01:07:41", "count": 1, "pub-type": "inproceedings", "booktitle": "GI-Jahrestagung", "series": "LNI", "publisher": "GI", "year": "2014", "url": "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/gi/gi2014.html#StegemannZ14", "author": ["Timo Stegemann", "J\u00fcrgen Ziegler"], "authors": [{"first": "Timo", "last": "Stegemann"}, {"first": "J\u00fcrgen", "last": "Ziegler"}], "editor": ["Erhard Pl\u00f6dereder", "Lars Grunske", "Eric Schneider", "Dominik Ull"], "editors": [{"first": "Erhard", "last": "Pl\u00f6dereder"}, {"first": "Lars", "last": "Grunske"}, {"first": "Eric", "last": "Schneider"}, {"first": "Dominik", "last": "Ull"}], "volume": "P-232", "pages": "479-490", "ee": "https://dl.gi.de/20.500.12116/2938", "isbn": "978-3-88579-626-8", "bibtexKey": "conf/gi/StegemannZ14"}, {"type": "Publication", "id": "https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/293b00594b58ffae863a5546972846f4a/indc", "tags": ["imported"], "intraHash": "93b00594b58ffae863a5546972846f4a", "interHash": "2fe5d74688c9011e17f1113521612313", "label": "Assessment of Nuclear Data Needs for Broad-Group SCALE Library Related to VVER Spent Fuel Applications", "user": "indc", "description": "", "date": "2010-12-04 16:55:32", "changeDate": "2010-12-04 16:55:42", "count": 1, "pub-type": "techreport", "year": "1999", "url": "http://www-nds.iaea.org/reports-new/indc-reports/indc-czr/indc-czr-0001.pdf", "author": ["K.
